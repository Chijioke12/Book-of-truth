You, whose god is Satan, know that your souls are blackened with the cloud of evil, which is infested in you by the evil one. You are in great danger yet you choose to worship the devil who wants to steal your souls and torment you for eternity.
Your plans to dictate, rule, control and mastermind genocide against God's children will not only be thwarted by the Hand of My Father but this evil will be turned upon you.
You will be severely punished for your wickedness.

The sins you are guilty of are abhorrent to Me and your hatred and contempt for those people, those whom you claim to serve in your governments, will destroy you for eternity.
The brief spell you will enjoy, when you seize the reins of power over nations and introduce a wicked dictatorship regime will bring you an eternal life of Hell.
You will be given many chances to turn your back on the evil group of elite powers. But be careful for you will only be given so much time.
Never underestimate the Power of God. Do not underestimate His Anger. For while a God of great Mercy, He, God, My Eternal Father, is also one to be feared.
His power is almighty. His power over Satan will culminate shortly and He will cast out the Beast and his cohorts into the lakes of fire.
You, too, will be cast into Hell should you continue to destroy God's Creation, God's children. My Father will never forgive you if you step beyond the boundaries of His Great Mercy.
On the day I come to judge you will tremble with the deepest fear unknown to humanity.

On that day you will be accorded the punishment as in the way you treated your brothers and sisters, children of God. Be warned. For the Anger of God is to be feared.
Your Jesus

A Protestant nation, Great Britain, will convert soon to My Ways
Monday, September 17th, 2012 @ 21:15

My dearly beloved daughter I wish to reveal to you a miracle I have planned.

A Protestant nation, Great Britain, will convert soon to My Ways, My Teachings and the Truth.

For so long this Christian country has adapted and amended the Laws of God to suit their proud ways.

Once a great Christian country, they sinned throughout the centuries against the Laws of God and convinced themselves that they followed the Laws laid down by My Church on earth.
The prayers of the faithful among them and the love and loyalty shown by Christian leaders in Great Britain, in the face of adversity, has brought them closer to My Sacred Heart.
This country will be converted and the Truth will save millions.

The antichrist and his many followers have influenced many in power in this country but they will fail to steal God's children. My followers will unite through all churches throughout Britain and I will envelop them in My Holy Arms.
They will become a powerful force in My army and the plan to unite them has commenced. Here is a special Crusade Prayer for God's children in Britain
Crusade Prayer (77) For Great Britain

O Most Heavenly Father, God the Creator of man please hear my prayer. I beg You to save Britain from the clutches of evil and dictatorship.
I ask that You unite all of us, of all religions, creed and colour as one family in Your Eyes. Give us the strength to unite in defiance of any laws introduced to outlaw Your Teachings.
Give us the strength and the courage to never forsake You and to help save all of Your children through our prayers.

Bring all of my brothers and sisters together in unity to pay homage to Your promise to bring us eternal life and entrance to Your Paradise. Amen.
To the children of Great Britain know that, soon, the conversion which will envelop your country will bring you great graces. Then you will help lead My army along with other nations towards My Glorious Kingdom.
Your Jesus.

I am not the Son of Man people expect Me to be. I am unconventional.

My dearly beloved daughter it has been a very tough journey for those followers of mine who follow this mission. They are ridiculed by those whose opinions they value.
They are mocked by those who claim to be spiritually mature and they are spat upon by those who deny Me, Jesus Christ.
They must accept the Crown of Thorns and the humility which is needed to bear the pain of suffering in My Holy Name. Let no man underestimate the thorny path towards eternal salvation.
If you endure the agony you will be purified quickly and then you will be able to help the others whose purification will not take place until after The Warning.
There will be times, My beloved disciples, when lies will be planted in your minds by others who want you to abandon My mission.
You must simply remain firm, courteous and then stay silent when you face this persecution.

Never argue or try to prove the authenticity of My Holy Word for you will trip up and then you will fall. It will be then that you will be kicked and you will find it difficult to move on to promote My Holy Word. In, other words, you will become stuck. Then confusion will set in and, in some cases, you will turn your back on Me.
Many of My followers, who took up their cross to follow Me in this mission, to save souls, could not continue on their arduous journey.
Some allowed others to plant the seeds of doubt in their minds.

Others believed the lies they were told to deny this, My last holy mission on earth to prepare humanity for My Second Coming.
Only those with a simple love for Me, with a deep loyalty, and who understand the role of suffering in the salvation of souls, had the stamina to continue.
It is not easy to follow Me, your Jesus. While following My teachings may bring you closer to My Sacred Heart, it is only when you surrender, to the reality that is the Cross, can you really call yourself a disciple of Mine.
Many poor souls believe that they will receive great power, great glory and recognition in the world when your respond to My Call. This is not the case.
I am a suffering victim and therein lies My power over Satan.

I am not the Son of Man people expect Me to be. I am unconventional. I chose unworthy souls to deliver My messages.

I call the poorest, the meekest and the greatest of sinners because I need to show you that you are all equal in My Eyes. But it will only be those who accept that only those humble of mind and soul can be embraced by Me and who will walk quickly towards spiritual perfection.
Suffer in My Name and I will raise you up in glory in the New Paradise.

Accept the Truth of My Divinity, in that I will never exalt Myself through My genuine prophets, nor will they seek glory in My Name. Now, come to Me with a trust and abandonment so I can make you Mine.
Your Jesus

Conversion takes place first. Then the persecution. Then the Salvation. In that order.

My dearly beloved daughter a great shift is now taking place in the world and the Light of My Mercy is approaching. Let no man believe that what I say will come to pass will not take place.
I speak only the Truth so you must trust in Me.

My Holy Spirit is descending rapidly on humanity now to prepare them for My Great Mercy.

Let no man fail to prepare or spread My Word so that souls can be saved.

All is good now My daughter in that all is in place for My Word to spread like a wild flower which will take root in every nation.

The sweet fragrance of My Gift of love is being felt even by those with little faith. For they are aware of a change and a shift but do not understand what is happening.
Tell them that the Lord God, King of Mercy, is preparing to return for the second time to save them.

My Covenant is nearing the stage when conversion takes place first. Then the persecution. Then the Salvation. In that order.

Trust in Me and prepare yourselves for the time of the conversion of much of humanity is close.

Many obstacles are being placed before you My disciples. This is what you must do.

Walk straight. Head towards Me on the path and remain dignified no matter what insults are hurled at you. By doing so, and not engaging with the beast who works through others to make you doubt your faith, you defeat him.
This is why I remained silent and barely responded to My accusers, My executioners. For to do so would have given power to Satan.
My death destroyed the power he had over God's children. He then lost his power to steal all souls. Now that I come again very soon he will lose all power. But until then he will continue to steal souls.
Be strong. Be calm. Be brave. I am with you. When you surrender your will and trust in Me completely you will be safe. Your Jesus

They will say that I was married. They will say that I was simply a prophet.

I am your Mystical Spouse and, as such, you will continue to suffer to save souls.

My dearly beloved daughter the time for the lies about Me to be spread all over the world has begun.

As I told you before they will invent lies and create falsities about Me, Jesus Christ, so that they can deny My Divinity. My Divinity is Almighty.
I came in the flesh and humbled Myself in a way in which people did not expect.

I did not come dressed as a king.

I did not shout or boast like a king so that others would fall down at My Feet. I did not command others to wait on Me.
Instead, I came to serve.

I came to beg for your salvation. To do this I had to humble myself by becoming a man, a poor man, of humble origins.

While I came as a man this did not mean that My Divinity was compromised in any way. I was born without sin. It was impossible for Me to sin. I may have had the same desires of the flesh as man but I never committed sin for this could not be. I was pure in mind, body and spirit.
I was like man in so many ways. But I rose from the dead.

The lies, which will emerge, where they will deny the Truth of My Existence through a series of untruths, will begin to flood the earth.
They will say that My Body can still be found. They will say that I was married. They will say that I was simply a prophet. They will then try to prove, once again, that I was a heretic. That I blasphemed against God. They will ridicule My Words as they are being given to the world now and then dismiss Me.
They do this for two reasons. The first is to defile My Divinity and to present Me as a mere man. The second is to create doubt as to My role as the Messiah.
How they insult My Name.

How they confuse My followers.

Do not listen to lies.

Do not listen when they try to convince you that God did not create the universe. For all of these distractions are designed to weaken your faith and steal your souls.
Block your ears to such wickedness. Close your eyes to untruths as every effort will be made to convince you that I was not the Messiah, the Saviour and Redeemer of mankind.
How blind they are.

How little they have learned.

Your Jesus

God the Father The time of My Son is being merged with your time children and soon all will become one
