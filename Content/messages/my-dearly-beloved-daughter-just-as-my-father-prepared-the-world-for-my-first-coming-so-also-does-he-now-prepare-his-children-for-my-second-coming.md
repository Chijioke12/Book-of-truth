The whole of Heaven rejoiced when I was born, for they knew that I was sent to save humanity from eternal damnation. Now the Hierarchy of all the angels and all the saints rejoice for now the preparations are underway to prepare the world to welcome Me, Jesus Christ, the Son of Man once again.
Only My Father knows of the dates but I can tell you that it will take place not too long after The Warning has occurred.

This is the time My Father has waited patiently for. Finally He can throw the beast and his demons, who walk the earth tormenting His children, into the abyss.
The Warning will purify God's children in preparation for My Second Coming.

It is necessary because it will mean that many people will now seek forgiveness for their sins; who would not otherwise have done so.
The earthquakes, the storms, the floods and unseasonal weather will combine to purge the earth of poison. The land, sea and air will also be purified in readiness for the New Paradise, when the Heavens and Earth will merge as one.
All is carefully organised, according to the Divine Plans of My Father. Very little is known amongst men of the Divine Laws, which govern My Father's Kingdom on earth and in the Heavens.
Much has been taught to you, through the prophets and through My Teachings. Yet much remains a mystery to you. When the mysteries are revealed to you, in time, you will then understand the reason for human suffering.
Many of you learned scholars of God adhere, as best you can, to the Laws laid down by Me. Know then that the Love that God has for His children surpasses any theological reasoning.
The same is true of the simple soul who feels a genuine love, without analysing why, for Me their beloved Jesus.

By trusting in Me, and accepting that My Love is Merciful and Patient, then know that I will fulfil the Promises made by My Father.

His Divine Will be done at last. Only His Will can ensure peace among His children. This will be the manifestation so that all His Creation will love Him, accept His Love and the Gifts, which he wishes to shower upon His children.
The world has glimpsed just a fraction of the wonders created by My Father.

His children have yet to witness the True Glory of the Kingdom He has waiting for them.

After much pain and suffering, caused by the hatred inflicted upon the earth by the fallen angels, led by Satan, all will now be resolved.
The final battle will see the destruction of evil being finally completed.

The Warning is a Miracle, permitted by My Father, to ensure that as many of His children as possible can enter My New Kingdom.
Because of the apostasy and the doctrinal errors, spread by misguided sacred servants, over the last four decades, this is the only way to unite humanity quickly.
The size of the population of the world at this time means that billions can be saved through this Miracle of the Illumination of Conscience.
As the time moves now into the Great Tribulation I, the Lamb of God, will reveal to the world the true meaning of the contents of the Seals, given to John.
The Book of Truth is the Word of God, given to mankind already up to now through My Father's Book. It reminds God's children of the Truth, as so many have forgotten it.
It will also reveal some of the mysteries of the end times, as given to Daniel, so that all of you are prepared to enter the New Paradise by your own free will.

Do not reject the Truth, as it is now being given to you, for it would be akin to a sick man refusing treatment for an illness. Without the Truth you will be ill prepared to enter My New Paradise.
Your Jesus

The Fire of the Holy Spirit will be felt in the hearts of everyone
Sunday, December 9th, 2012 @ 19:00

My dearly beloved daughter, it is My desire, not to frighten My followers, but rather, to demonstrate the Love and Compassion which I hold in My Heart for every man, woman and child.
It is because of My Love for every one of God's children, including those who defy the Word of God, that I wish to cover them with My Flame of Mercy.
Be prepared, all of you, for soon you will witness the Power of God and His Divine Intervention in the world, when He will stop all that is, for a period of fifteen minutes.
The Fire of the Holy Spirit will be felt in the hearts of everyone.

For those who are in a state of grace, it will be a feeling of joy, love and compassion for Me, your Jesus.

For those in a state of venial sin, you will feel the pain of Purgatory, but you will soon be purified and then you will feel a deep peace and love within your hearts for Me.
For those of you in mortal sin, you will experience the wretchedness and pain as if you have been plunged into the fires of Hell.

Some of you, in this state of sin, will beg for My forgiveness and favour to stop your internal suffering. This I will grant to you if you can find true remorse in your heart and accept that your sins cause Me grievous hurt and pain for they insult God.
Then there will be those poor unfortunate souls who will spit at Me, fight with Me and then turn their backs. The terror, they will feel, will be because their souls are infested by Satan.
They will not be able to stand the pain when they witness My Light and they will run into the embrace of the evil one whose darkness brings them comfort.
Finally there will be those who will die instantly because of the shock they will experience. Please pray for these souls every day, for your prayers will gain for them entrance to My Kingdom.
This is one of the greatest miracles ever accorded to God's children.

My Revelation to you, during this event, will wake you up to the fact that My Promise, to come back to save the human race so they can inherit the Glorious Life ahead, will soon be realised.
Your Jesus

I will Judge the Living and the Dead and only those who are worthy can enter My Kingdom
Monday, December 10th, 2012 @ 22:22

My dearly beloved daughter, please tell all those who follow My Teachings to remind themselves of My Promise. I have made it clear that I will come again to salvage My Kingdom.
My Second Coming is awaited and those who profess to know the Truth, which is contained in My Father's Book, will know that it does not contain untruths.
I will come again as foretold and this time is almost upon you.

I will judge the Living and the Dead and only those who are worthy can enter My Kingdom.

It has also been foretold that the evil one will prepare a war on earth to fight My Father for souls.

This is a war he cannot win and yet many of those who live their lives based on false promises believe that their earthly lives are all that matter. The deceit, which has taken hold over many people, will be their downfall.
Oh how I yearn for those souls to open their eyes to the Truth in time, before it is too late for them.

My pain and anguish now as I envisage those poor deluded souls who will be lost to Me has never been so intense. This is why victim souls, chosen souls and those who are close to My Sacred Heart, feel such pain right now. I suffer through them as the time approaches.
All the plans by My Father to envelop His children and cover them with His Seal of Protection are in place.

Every soul is being sought by Him. The Holy Spirit is covering so many souls at this moment in history in order to entice them into My Sacred Arms.
Please do not deny My Promise. Accept that My Second Coming will be witnessed by you of this generation.

It is good news. My Return will be the moment of My Glorification, which will renew all those who love Me and they will begin a new life, a time of great splendour, where they will rejoice in Light and Love.
Please do not be frightened.

I come with Great Love.

I come with a Great Gift.

You will be taken into your true home and you will be united with your own family.

All of God's children, favoured to enter this new Glorious Existence, will become as one.

Love will be everywhere. Peace, joy, laughter, companionship, wonders and the Adoration of God, will be part of every moment. Death will not exist. Hatred will be dead.
Evil will be banished.

The whole of mankind will no longer suffer or experience pain or imperfection of any kind. This is My New Paradise. The time for tears will be no more.
Trust in Me, My followers, for the pain and suffering you are experiencing is almost over. I know how you suffer because of the unjust regimes under which you must live. This is the final period, for the Hand of My Father will now intervene.
The world will change. The old will be cast away and a New Dawn will emerge in all God's Glory when His Power will Reign, as it was meant to be, since the Creation of the world.
Your Beloved Jesus

Virgin Mary: He, so humble, will come in great glorious splendour and His Great Mercy will flood the earth
Tuesday, December 11th, 2012 @ 17:00

My dear little ones, my Heart rejoices because the Reign of my Son is very close.

For all His suffering, His rejection by ungrateful men and the apostasy, which covers the earth, He will bring great glory to mankind.
He will come on a great cloud and His Majesty will overcome every single soul who will fall at His Feet in ecstasy. He, so humble, will come in great glorious splendour and His Great Mercy will flood the earth.
Children, you must prepare because you will need great strength to surrender before Him. You will be required to show humility and beg Him to redeem your souls so that you can see the Light of the Truth.
His Great Mercy will be seized by many of you. Others, however, will ignore His Presence and the Great Gift, which He will bring.

Pray, pray, pray for those who refuse to accept the existence of eternal life, for these people need your help. It will bring great joy if you can find it in your heart to ask my Son to save these souls.
You, my children, will soon see the end of your suffering because my Son, in His Mercy, has great plans for every person alive on the earth today.
Be thankful for the Gift of life you have been given when you were born.

Be thankful because of the Gift of Eternal Life, which my Son will soon present to the world. This Gift is for every single sinner. It will be by your free will whether or not you will accept it.
Come to me, children, as I will take you into the refuge of my Immaculate Heart and prepare you so that I can take you to my Son in readiness for His Second Coming.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

Traitors of My Holy Word, sent through God's prophets, will, I solemnly promise, result in the Wrath of My Father
Wednesday, December 12th, 2012 @ 23:54

My dearly beloved daughter, how it saddens Me to see so much division, which My Holy Word, given through these Messages, has caused.
When My Word, given to visionaries and genuine prophets, is made known to the world, it attracts immediate criticism. Why is this? It is because it is I, your Jesus, Whose Holy Word will always be questioned and criticized, before it is denounced as heresy by sinners.
Human reasoning, while important in the role of discernment, plays a very small part in recognising My Word.

The Love, which My Word sparks in a soul, which is empty of malice and which is pure and humble, will not nor can it be denied. It is through these souls that I grant the gift of being able to recognise Me. These souls, along with the prophet I chose to impart My Word, will have to accept My Cup of suffering.
I ask you to detach yourselves from the world's attractions and consecrate yourselves to Me, for this is a very harsh and lonely path when you follow Me.
When challenged in My Name, or when the voices of My true prophets are ridiculed and declared not to be from God, I say this to you.
Do not dignify such attacks with a response of any kind. Remain silent in your suffering.

The Voice of God will Reign over the world now and let no one take you away from the Truth, which is very important, so that I can bring you poor helpless sinners into My Holy Arms to calm you.
I bring you Peace. Arguments, criticism and public displays of authority, by those who proclaim My Word on the one hand, and condemn others in My Name on the other, must not be accepted. This kind of behaviour is not from God. It comes from the spirit of evil.
Remember it is not My prophets you hurt. It is I you offend.

You are guilty of wasting time and detracting from the Work of the Holy Spirit. You will not be permitted to sacrifice the souls of those who you dare to mislead in My Name.
You, who sin against Me by preventing the Word of God from being heard in these times, will be cast away. My patience is weary. My worries intense. My pain excruciating. You are trying to deceive My followers, whose role in leading My remnant army is paramount. For this you will be punished.

I plead with you to ask Me to come to you so that I can give you solace, for make no mistake, you are troubled souls and your sins are known to Me.
Your arrogance is offending and insulting to My Father. Your willingness to sacrifice your own souls, because of your ambition to be seen as intelligent and authoritative spokespersons for Me, is disgusting in My Eyes.
Traitors of My Holy Word, sent through God's prophets, will, I solemnly promise, result in the Wrath of My Father. Your punishment will be swift. Your time is limited. You have but a short time in which to choose which master you really serve.
Your Jesus

Humility is more than just the acceptance of suffering. It is a powerful means of defeating evil
Thursday, December 13th, 2012 @ 18:11

My dearly beloved daughter, the gift of humility must be earned. It must never be confused with cowardice.

It was because of My own Humility that Satan was fooled and, as such, lost the right to win all souls and curse them with eternal damnation.
Satan is arrogant, boastful, deceitful, and full of self-love and hatred. The battle for souls was won through the Act of Humility when I, the King of mankind, allowed Myself to be belittled, tortured, scorned, mocked and tormented by sinners infested with the hatred of Satan.
It is impossible for the beast to feel humility. He knew of the Power of God and how tough his battle against His children would be. He expected Me to, not only proclaim the Word of God, but to demonstrate My Authority amongst men by declaring Myself before them in an exalted state of majesty. Even then he was confident of defeating My Mission.
What he did not expect was My refusal to condemn My executioners, or the Humility I showed. My failure to engage with My tormentors meant that they had no power over Me. My tolerance of the scourging, mocking and persecution only further diluted the power of the evil one. He never expected this and tried everything, including physical torture, to get Me to renounce the human race.
It was My acceptance of My death, the sacrifice made by My Father, to permit My Crucifixion, that man was set free from sin.

This was the first battle fought and won. This is how the second battle will be fought, to bring humanity back into My Kingdom, so that they can enjoy eternal life.
He, the beast and all of his fallen angels, tempt many souls so that many are deceived and do not accept My Existence. Many of those who do are fighting hard, through the temptations placed before them, to ignore My Call at this time from Heaven.
Then there are those who pose as servants in My Church who are planning, along with the elite group, to destroy millions. They will do this by blocking My Word and then by physical persecution. Their final betrayal against God's children will be witnessed by all.
The souls I am most concerned about are those atheists and young people who have not been taught the Truth. I urge all of you who acknowledge Me, your Jesus, to bring them to Me. I surround them with My Light and Protection and I will fight the evil one right up to the last second for these souls.
You must march forward, My brave disciples, and try to block out the evil which surrounds you. If you engage with those who are desperate to stop this Mission you will fail Me.
Why, you may ask, are these people so desperate to block My Word? The answer is that it has always been like this where I walk, where I talk and where I Am present.
Move and keep close to Me. My Power will cover you and you will be protected. But do not take your eyes off Me because there are many who will threaten you, insult you, try to trip you up. When you hear the arrogant, but disorderly, verbal rants thrown at you, you will know what to do.
The more determined your adversaries are, in trying to convince you that it is not I, Jesus Christ, the King of mankind, who speaks with you now, then you will know that I Am truly present amongst you.
I walk with you as you stay close to Me. Your silence and refusal to engage with those taunts will keep you strong. Let those who shout abuse and ridicule My Holy Word do what they do. Pray for them hard, for they are in need of your help. Think of it like this.
Look at all of these people as if they are gathered together in a room and that they are only little children. When you look at young children you feel a deep love because of their vulnerability. You see the reliance they have for their parents and guardians and you feel overwhelmed by the love you have in your hearts for them.
Some of these children will behave according to what they have been told is the correct way to behave. Others show cruelty to the other children. And while you may be appalled by their behaviour, you know that you must correct them, and then punish them, if they continue to refuse to behave properly. Above all, you still love them, no matter what they do as they are the precious children of loving parents.
This is the way My Father feels for all of His children. It does not matter what they do because He still loves them. But He will not allow some of His children to destroy His other children and He will punish them, but only so that He can re-unite His family.
When you pray for those who offend God and who hurt His children, you cause terrible suffering to Satan, who loosens the grip he holds over the person for whom you pray.

Humility is more than just the acceptance of suffering. It is a powerful means of defeating evil. By praying for those who torment you, you bring Me a great gift of true love. A special love for Me, your Jesus.
I will continue to instruct you, My disciples, so that you will remain strong and faithful to My Teachings. It is in these times of great apostasy, that My Holy Gospel and My messages, now being given to prepare you, must be spread throughout the world in My campaign to save souls.
Your Jesus

I Am an all-forgiving God, ready to grant you freedom from the sins, which entrap you
Saturday, December 15th, 2012 @ 21:45

My dearly beloved daughter, I desire to reach out to those of you who are troubled in your lives at this time.

I call on those of you who are in deep sin and who are despairing of ever finding comfort because of the pain you are in. You may be guilty of grave sin, including murder, abortion, violence, sexual depravity, or you may have dabbled in the occult, but don't you know that all you must do is to turn to Me and ask Me to help you?
I Am an all-forgiving God, ready to grant you freedom from the sins, which entrap you. These sins can be banished from your life. All it takes is courage. Remember there is not one sin, other than the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit that I will not absolve you of.
It is not that sinners cannot remain in a state of grace for a long time, which blocks you from seeking My Pardon. It is the thought that I could never forgive you that keeps you away from Me.
My Mercy is so great that it will be given to those who ask for it.

I call out to all of you who are unsure of My Existence. I ask that you trust in Me. By confiding in Me, communicating with Me and asking Me to forgive you that you will receive the answer you crave.
I will respond and you will feel this in your heart when you recite the Crusade Prayer for the Grace of My Mercy for wretched sinners.
Crusade Prayer (89) For Wretched Sinners

Dear Jesus, help me a poor wretched sinner, to come to You with remorse in my soul. Cleanse me from the sins, which have destroyed my life.
Give me the gift of a new life free from the shackles of sin and the freedom, which my sins deny me. Renew me in the Light of Your Mercy.
Embrace me in Your Heart.

Let me feel Your Love so that I can become close to You and that my love for You is ignited. Have Mercy on me, Jesus, and keep me free from sin.
Make me worthy to enter Your New Paradise. Amen.
