As the wars and unrest spread in every direction the faith of my church will continue to weaken. The schism in My Holy Church is about to develop quickly.
Priest against priest.

Bishop against Bishop.

The world is about to undergo the next stage of cleansing.

Anger against My Father will emerge in every country in the world.

My followers will now experience suffering for their faith in a way they have not experienced before. The pain felt by those poor souls is a reflection of the pain that I am enduring right now.
All those in union with Me, their beloved Jesus, will know without doubt in their souls, that My Holy Spirit now rests within them.
They will instantly know when they witness sin around them and how it pains Me.

When they see wars inflicted on the innocent they will feel My torment in every bone of their bodies.

When they see the sin of abortion paraded in front of them, as if it were of no consequence, they will be riddled with My pain. Sin is escalating. The faith of My church is dissipating.
The loyalty of My sacred servants is weakening.

Belief in My teachings is being dismissed by My sacred servants where My flock are told lies about the seriousness of sin.

Then there are My beloved priests, nuns and clergy of all religious denominations who believed in Me and My Eternal Father who are enduring the pain of having to witness the spread of sin like wildfire which is engulfing nations everywhere at a ferocious speed.
No matter how difficult this is you must stay strong and keep united in My name.

Prayer is now needed and you must spend at least one hour a day doing this in order to mitigate events which will now unfold in the world.
Christian churches are being targeted and tormented by secular groups.

They will seek to abolish all things which honour Me, their Divine Saviour Jesus Christ. The hatred being instilled in their souls is by the hand of satan.
Pray, pray now that those souls who inflict pain and suffering on God's children can be saved. Your Jesus

Don't you know that the Holy Spirit cannot and will not enter the souls of those with hardened hearts?

My dearly beloved daughter the timing of My Father's will is not for your knowing.

My followers must be patient as everything in the world will evolve as prophesised in My Father's Book.

All of this will be according to My Father's timing and the effect that your prayers will have in helping to avert global wars. It is not long for all My promises to be fulfilled.
You, My followers, must trust in Me, your beloved Jesus. Pray for souls and leave everything in My hands.
Never forget to pray to My Father as often as you can for the Seal of the Living God in order to protect you and your families.

Crusade Prayer (33) to ask for the Seal of the Living God and accept it with love, joy and gratitude.

O My God, My loving Father
I accept with love and gratitude Your Divine Seal of Protection
Your Divinity encompasses my body and soul for eternity
I bow in humble thanksgiving and offer you my deep love and loyalty To you my Beloved Father
I beg you to protect me and my loved ones with this special Seal And I pledge my life to your service forever and ever
I love you Dear Father
I console you in these times Dear Father

I offer you the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of your dearly beloved Son
In atonement for the sins of the world and for the salvation of all your children.

Amen.

Ensure also that you encourage others to pray the seven day Crusade Prayer (24) to seek redemption for your sins.

O My Jesus you are the light of the earth You are the flame that touches all souls Your mercy and love knows no bounds
We are not worthy of the sacrifice you made by your death on the cross Yet we know that your love for us is greater than the love we hold for you
Grant us O Lord the gift of humility so that we are deserving of your New Kingdom Fill us with the Holy Spirit so we can march forth and lead your army
to proclaim the truth of your Holy Word and prepare our brothers and sisters For the Glory of Your Second Coming on earth
We honour You We Praise You
We offer ourselves, our sorrows, our sufferings as a gift to you to save souls We love you Jesus
Have Mercy on all your children wherever they may be. AMEN
