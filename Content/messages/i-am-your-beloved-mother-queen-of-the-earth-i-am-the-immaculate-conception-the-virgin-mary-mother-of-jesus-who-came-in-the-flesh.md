My child, the time for the triumph of My Immaculate Heart is close.

The time for me to crush the serpent is drawing nearer. But until the day when Satan and his demons are cast into the wilderness, much confusion will erupt on earth.
For believers in my Son, it will be a time of torment. They will be pulled into two different directions by the Catholic Church.
One half will believe, out of duty, the need to follow the False Prophet, the Pope who will follow Pope Benedict XVI

He, the beast, is dressed like a lamb but is not from my Father, God the Most High, and will fool poor souls including priests, bishops and cardinals.
Many will follow him and believe him to be sent by God to rule over His Church on earth. Sadly, many souls will follow his teachings which will be insulting to My Father.
Others, filled with the Holy Spirit and given the graces of discernment because of their humble souls, will know instantly, that an imposter sits in the Church in Rome.
The new false Pope is already scheming, even before he ascends to the throne of the Seat of Peter, to denounce the teachings of my Son. Then he will denounce me, the Blessed Mother of God, and ridicule my role as Co-Redemptrix..
My child, your role is going to become even harder than before. For many of my children are very confused. The insults you face every day, the torments you endure on behalf of my Son, will increase.
Never be afraid to tell the world the truth my child.

You are being made stronger as a result of the physical and mental suffering you accept on behalf of my Son in order to save souls.
Every effort, especially by one division in the Catholic Church, will be made to dismiss my messages given to you.

Your obedience and loyalty to me and my beloved Son will be tested as never before. This may lead you to pull away but, should this happen, it will not last long.
Pray, my child, for all of God's children who, through no fault of their own, are being pulled into the final battle for souls.

All of this must come to pass for it is contained in my Father's Book.

All the angels in Heaven protect you, my child, in this somewhat lonely mission. Always remember how important prayer is.
Pray, pray, pray for without prayer, especially the recital of my Holy Rosary, Satan can pull you away from the Holy Word of my Precious Son.
Remember also the importance of fasting for it keeps the deceiver at bay. Without regular prayer, my children, will find it hard to remain close to my Son.
Never fear the future children for once you remain close to my Son you will be protected

And given the necessary graces to prepare your souls and those of your families for the New Era of Peace foretold so long ago. Your beloved Mother
Queen of the Earth Mother of Salvation

The hatred will mount against you. You will be told that this work is from Satan

My dearly beloved daughter why is it that you, sometimes, question the graces I have given you?

The gift of reading souls was given to you so that you can discern the intentions of those poor souls who will try to undermine My Holy Word.
This gift will enable you to feel compassion for such souls and help them to find the truth path to eternal life and to free their souls from the torment that they endure.
This gift will also enable you to identify false prophets.

You will know instantly who comes in My name and who does not.

At first you will feel a terrible sinking feeling of fear because you will recognise Satan's work. You will know immediately when he is present in others.
When he attacks you, through others, you will feel like you have been kicked in the stomach.

You will feel nauseous when you come face to face with someone whose soul has been stolen by Satan and you will tremble and feel dizzy.
You will speak, however to such souls with My words and with a strength you will not recognise as your own. Many who come to you with pure souls, will feel the light and My presence surge through their bodies.
Few, of humble heart and a deep love for Me, will fail to respond to My Holy Spirit which has flooded your soul.

My daughter this is now a difficult stage of your mission.

The hatred will mount against you.

You will be told that this work is from Satan.

Don't you know how Satan, the deceiver, works? He convinces good souls that when My word is spoken that it is not from Me?

He tries to convince others, through their fear of him, that the traits associated with him are present in others.

He causes doubts and distress in souls by deceiving them. By blinding them to the truth and by preventing them from receiving graces designed by Me to sanctify their souls.
Those he attacks the most are those who are closest to Me.

This includes not only visionaries and prophets but the very souls I need to help form My army. This army will defeat Satan. He knows this and will never give up in his quest for souls.
Remember this though. Satan does not have the power that I have. He cannot defeat the Holy Trinity. He is powerless against My Mother who has been given authority to destroy him. He fears her.
To all those who doubt My word, given through these messages, please ask My beloved Mother to bring you closer to My Sacred Heart.
Ask her to cover you with her holy mantle and give you the protection you need from the evil one. Remember the evil one is full of hatred.
When you find hatred of any kind in your heart, especially towards My holy messengers, know that Satan has tempted you to sin.
That is when you must ask Me for the graces to make you strong.

Remember, I will never turn My back on any of you including those of you who hate My messengers and those souls who reject Me.
Your loving Saviour Jesus Christ

The next Pope may be elected by members within the Catholic Church but he will be the False Prophet

My dearest daughter many people still reject Me in the world and it has to do with public opinion.

So much darkness has descended over all of God's children that very few have the courage to publicly proclaim My Word.

Believers are frightened of the verbal abuse and vicious mockery they would have to endure were they to speak openly of My Holy Word.
Even devout followers lack the nerve to stand up and fight evil laws introduced in their countries which defy the word of My Father.

Priests are embarrassed to be seen to stand up for the truth of My teachings for fear of being ostracised.

Now, more than ever, because of the shame they have to endure because of the wicked sins of some of their own orders, they find it impossible for their voices to be heard.
When a brave sacred servant decides to stand up and defend the truth of My teachings they suffer terribly. They are accused of lack of tolerance, lack of compassion, lack of love and lack of respect for human rights.
You see, children, the truth of My teachings, spoken through My sacred servants is treated as a lie. Lies, those twisted versions of the truth contained in Holy Scripture, are presented as the truth instead.
Satan has won over so many souls, including leaders within My own Church which has meant that many innocent people find it hard to pledge allegiance to My Holy Will.
How I have been deserted and pushed to one side to allow the lies, planted in the minds of My Sacred Servants, to be accepted by the majority.
These wicked lies extend way beyond this.

The truth of My Scripture, contained in the Book of Revelation, has been interpreted by My many churches. So many variations, all of which are based on human interpretation.
My beloved Pope Benedict XVI is the last true Pope on this earth.

Peter the Roman, is My Peter, the original apostle who will rule My Church from the Heavens under the command of My Eternal Father. Then, when I come to reign, at the Second Coming, he will rule over all of God's children when all religions will become one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.
I only speak the truth My daughter.

I must warn you that many new self-proclaimed prophets will now emerge, who will contradict My Holy Word given to you, the end time true prophet.
First they will convince believers that their words come from Me.

Their words will be carefully chosen and their meaning will be vague and a little confusing. But many will dismiss this weakness and embrace their messages because they seem to be in line with Holy Scripture.
When many souls have been seduced, the attack will begin.

They, My daughter, are being sent to prepare God's children to accept the next Pope, who comes after My beloved Vicar Pope Benedict. This Pope may be elected by members within the Catholic Church but he will be the False Prophet.
His electors are wolves in sheep's clothing and are members of the secret Masonic and evil group led by Satan. This is how Satan will try to destroy My Church.
Sadly, he will, this False Prophet, attract a large following. Those who oppose him will be persecuted.

Run children, while you can. Denounce the lies which will be presented by those who attempt to convince you of the authenticity of the False Prophet.
Be strong. Stay faithful to Me, your Jesus. Never doubt My Holy Word. The Book of Revelation, is the true word of God. It does not lie.

Not all of the secrets contained within are known to you yet. I will reveal all through Maria Divine Mercy although the truth will be vehemently attacked and treated as heresy.
Remember one important lesson. My Word, when I was on earth, was treated as heresy when I came the first time.

My Word, given to you now, at My Second Coming will also be treated as such by believers, including My sacred servants who represent My Church on earth.
Satan will sacrifice many souls to satisfy his final cravings to cause the greatest heartache.

Be assured that it will be the Catholic church, founded by Me and placed under the command of My beloved apostle Peter, which will suffer the greatest in the end times.
Be on your guard at all times.

Please recite this Crusade Prayer (44) Strength to defend my faith against the False Prophet

Dear Jesus give me the strength to focus on your teachings And to proclaim your Holy Word at all times
Never allow me to be tempted to idolise the False Prophet who will try to present himself like you
Keep my love for you strong

Give me the graces of discernment so that I will never deny The truth contained in the Holy Bible no matter how many
Lies are presented to me to encourage me to turn my back on your true word. Amen.

The truth is written in Holy Scripture.

The Book of Revelation does not reveal all because I come only now, the Lamb of God, to open the book for the world to see. Any human interpretation regarding the 1,000 years is not to be trusted.
You must only trust in the word of God. Your beloved Jesus

So many lies, where the existence of Hell is denied, will be the downfall of Christians.

My dearest beloved daughter no matter how difficult your physical suffering is you must recognise that as it continues to intensify that it is as I feel.
Your suffering reflects just a fraction of My own suffering.

In union with Me you will know that for every pain and interior darkness of the soul you experience, you will know the torment I endure because of the sins of mankind.
Many people mistakenly believe that My suffering began and ended on the Cross.

My suffering will not end until all of God's children are united in love and harmony where no sin will exist in My Father's New Paradise.
No matter how much humanity has been told about My existence I am still hated.

Amongst believers, although I am accepted, My teachings are only tolerated by them based on their own terms.

Many will treat others with love and kindness but only if those, to whom they offer this gift, come up to their own ideologies.
For example many will condemn sinners when they should show kindness and pray for them. They must, instead, lead by example.
Some will pour scorn on others instead of showing the love that is expected of them as Christians.

Never condemn others even if you do not agree with them for that is not your right. No one, only God, has the authority to judge another.
While many believers continue to pay homage to Me it will be on their own terms.

Some will feel the need to set themselves apart from their brothers and sisters to show the world how learned they are in spiritual matters. They then use their own interpretations of what My Mercy really means.
How many times have you heard that God is ever merciful? He is so merciful that because He loves everyone He would never condemn them?
That He would never send a soul to Hell?

Well this is a lie. So many lies, where the existence of Hell is denied, will be the downfall of Christians.

People condemn themselves to Hell. I do not put them there. They choose it by refusing to turn their backs on mortal sin.

Nor will they seek forgiveness or show remorse. This is dangerous thinking and it is the duty of all Christians to warn others of the dangers of Hell.
So many, including those who refuse their children the sacrament of Baptism speak as if sin no longer matters. They believe that all sin 'will' be forgiven. This is not correct.
All sin 'can' be forgiven, no matter how black the sin but only if the sinner seeks forgiveness.

Now I speak to you from the Heavens to prepare all of God's children for My Second Coming and what do I find?

I speak to you from behind prison walls and in a cell into which you have cast Me because you refuse to believe that I could speak to you in this way.
Oh how you offend Me!

To those who have spent your lives devoted to me and who are knowledgeable about My Holy Scripture but who now reject Me I say this.
Your rejections of Me now will leave you tormented and in great sorrow when the truth is revealed to you Because then you will realise the souls which you cast aside when I needed your help to salvage them.

How you make me weep with frustration at your blindness caused because of your lack of humility.

You doubt My Holy Word when you should embrace it, grasp it, because you are a drowning soul and lack generosity of heart. I beg you to respond to My call.
Your beloved Jesus Redeemer of Mankind
