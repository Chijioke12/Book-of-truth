Your Jesus

When the 20 million in My army has been reached I will multiply this number into billions.

My dearly beloved daughter My wish to unite My followers as one army is already bearing fruit through these messages.

My army has already formed and is united through the Power of the Holy Spirit which is spreading like wildfire across the world.

For those of you who now accept My instructions, although you may think you are working together in small groups, you must know that My army now consists of over 25,000 dedicated soldiers who receive My Crusade Prayers each day.
Your dedication to Me, your beloved Jesus, brings Me so much comfort and joy for your prayers are saving millions and millions of souls every second of each day.
Were you to witness their gratitude you would never cease to continue to pray, such is its power. Satan is suffering because of this mission and he will do everything possible to sabotage it.
This is why you must not allow outside bullying by those who accuse you of heresy to delay you with the spreading of My messages.
If you allow others to confuse you, those who try to humiliate you or who sneer at your faith, then fewer souls can be saved.
Think of this mission in the same way as if you were working for an overseas aid agency, those groups of people who go into ravaged countries to save the lives of those suffering from famine.
It is vital that you overcome all obstacles to get aid to the victims. One hour's delay can mean the difference between life or death. The same is true of this mission.
Look in front of you, ignore the interference of who will try to pull you back and then march forward. Gather others in your path and lead them towards victory. The victory of salvation.
Your army swells every day. Hold on to My Hand until we reach the army I desire of 20 million which will spearhead the battle against the antichrist.
When the 20 million in My army has been reached I will multiply this number into billions. And when this happens the beast will finally be destroyed.
This is My promise. For in great numbers God's children, filled with His Divine Love will destroy evil. Love, remember is stronger than hatred. Only love, in abundance, can wipe out evil.
Your Jesus

It is the sin of abortion which will be the downfall of many nations and for this they will be punished severely.
