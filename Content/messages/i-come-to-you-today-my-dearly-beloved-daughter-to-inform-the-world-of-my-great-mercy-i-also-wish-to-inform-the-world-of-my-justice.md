Children you do not have much time before I come to Judge.

It is the period between now and My Day of Judgement which will take place at My Second Coming that you must use wisely to prepare your souls.
As your Divine Saviour, it is My duty to guide you, instruct you and reveal ways in which you can ensure that you are fit to enter My Paradise.
Do not reject My prophets. I refer, in particular to My Sacred Servants.

You must ask Me to cover you with My Holy Spirit for discernment with humility and purity of soul. When you do I will reveal to you the truth of My Most Holy Word given to you now through this prophet.
After that it will be your duty to ensure that all those souls who look to you for guidance are helped to prepare their souls for My Second Coming.
Never be afraid to utter the phrase The Second Coming of Christ, for many of My flock do not know what it means.

So few of them have been taught about this great and glorious event or the importance of preparing their souls so that they are in a state of grace.
Never be afraid to preach about the existence of Purgatory or Hell. It is your responsibility to tell My people the truth.

Look to Me for guidance through this prayer Crusade Prayer (40) Prayer for the Clergy for preparing souls for the Second Coming

O My Jesus

I am but a humble servant and need you to guide me

So I can prepare souls for your Glorious Second Coming Help me to convert souls and prepare them
According to your Holy Will so that they are fit

To enter the New Heaven and Earth which you promised all of Mankind through your death on the cross.
Give me the graces I need so that I can impart

Your word to thirsty souls and that I never waiver in my

Duty to you dear Jesus to whom I pledged my allegiance through My Sacred Vows. Amen.

Go now My Sacred Servant and accept the role for which you were chosen.

The challenge of preparing souls for My Second Coming is the biggest ever in your ministry and you must accept this with love and joy in your hearts.
Accept also the gift of being chosen as a sacred servant in these, the end of times, when the New Heaven and Earth emerges as My New Paradise.
You are blessed to be living in these times.

But you will be tormented and obstructed on every part of your journey when you help to save My souls on earth by the deceiver and all those he tempts to turn your hearts away from Me your Divine Saviour.
Never give up in your Holy Mission and know that I, your Jesus, will walk with you every step of the way.
