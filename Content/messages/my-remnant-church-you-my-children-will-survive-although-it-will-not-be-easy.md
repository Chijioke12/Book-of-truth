You will be bullied because of your Christianity but you will never denounce Me or reject Me.

For this you will be given Gifts. My Gift of the Seal of the Living God will render you invisible to your enemies. Recite it every day from now on. Keep it before you in your homes and have it Blessed by a priest.
Begin your preparation soon for the day of the fallout in Europe is not far away. Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: My visionaries in the world will be instructed to pray in order to avert the dangers associated with a world war.
