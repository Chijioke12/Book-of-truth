A child who is nurtured by the pure love of his parents is blessed for this is a taste of the Love, which God has for all of His children.
My Love is especially present in the heart of the family unit, for the love, which forms it, becomes reminiscent of the Holy Family.
All nations of the world are united as one with God. All are part of the same family. In some families there is much love and all the children are in harmony with their parents.
In other families there is division, with children wandering off and falling into despair.

When a child wanders off the path of Truth and finds himself embroiled in wayward deeds, he causes much disruption in his family.
When he is in pain and is addicted to sinful pleasures of the flesh, he causes terrible anguish for his parents.

When he refuses to allow them to help him, they are not only saddened and frustrated, but they become ill with worry.

When he turns his back on his brothers and sisters, causes them pain and anguish, and rejects them, he is rejecting his entire family.
This broken family, although united, save for the wayward son, cannot find peace.

They would sacrifice everything if only to save their poor distracted child from destroying his chance of happiness in life. The same is true of God's children who reject His Hand of Love and Mercy. How this makes Him weep with sorrow.
For those followers of Mine who witness these lost souls, who wander the world seeking solace in things not of God, they also feel sorrow in their hearts. They also feel fear because they know that unless these poor souls ask Me, their Jesus, to save them, then they would otherwise be lost forever.
My Living Church on earth, comprised of all of My followers, needs to help Me to salvage every single soul. Without all of God's Family it will be a painful reunion, were just one soul be lost to Me.
We are one, all of God's children. Bring Me, through your prayers, the souls of those amongst you, including those who will not accept the Existence of God and those who are embroiled in such sinful lives, they cannot find an easy escape.
Then bring to Me the souls of those deluded sinners who fall into every trap laid down before them by the evil one.

Where there is a will, on the part of My disciples, to help salvage souls, I will multiply those souls one thousand times. This I promise you. Your efforts will not go to waste. Every scrap of your suffering, which you endure in My Name, offered to Me willingly, will be used to salvage most of humanity.
Love your family as I love you. Love your brothers and sisters as you would in your own family and I will shower you with graces. Love your enemies and prove it by praying for them and I will salvage their souls.
Your Jesus

The flame of love extinguishes the fire of hatred

My dearly beloved daughter, it is only when you are the target of hatred that you can truly understand the power, which the evil one has over humanity.
Hatred is caused by Satan who uses it to tempt people to turn on their fellow brothers and sisters. Hatred breeds hatred, when one person hates another and it is usually caused by anger.
Anger can come about as a result of a difference of opinion. Unless it is controlled, it can turn to hatred very quickly.

When someone attacks another person, an organisation or a nation, because of the difference of opinion, it can spark a torrent of hatred within a quick period of time.
This is why I urge all those who find themselves the target of such anger, to remain dignified at all times. Even when someone insults you, face to face or behind your back, you must be careful not to engage with them. When you do, you will be tempted to sin.
Satan encourages people to become angry. He then uses anger to create anger in the next person, and so it continues until hatred is instilled on both sides.
He, the evil one, inspires hatred so that he can cause division.

Division is the opposite to unity. Unity is a God given Grace. When people are united as one and respect each other, love is present. Love is God, so God has inspired this unity.
Satan uses hatred to cause nations to divide, marriages to break down, murders to take place and vicious crime to thrive. When Satan has been conquered, hatred will be finally banished and it won't exist in the world again.
Love can deplete hatred. When a person is angry towards you, you must try to respond with love. It may be very difficult for you to do this but, with My help, you will find that the hatred will be diluted quickly.
The flame of love extinguishes the fire of hatred. It cancels it out. Love is God and, as God has great Power over the beast, then this is the solution for driving the beast out of your lives.
It takes great courage to stand up, as victims, against hatred. If you do as I ask of you and call on Me to give you the courage, then you can defeat hatred.
Your Jesus
