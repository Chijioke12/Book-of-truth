Who are blind to your promise of salvation

I beseech you, with the help of my prayers and suffering, To open the eyes of non-believers so that they can see your Tender love and run into your sacred arms for protection
Help them to see the truth and seek forgiveness for all their sins

So that they can be saved and be the first to enter the Gates of the New Paradise

I pray for these poor souls including men, women and children and urge you to absolve them for their sins. Amen.

Go now My precious army and focus on My poor lost children. Help Me, your Jesus, to save their souls. Your beloved Saviour
Jesus Christ
