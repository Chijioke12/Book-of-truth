Pray that my faith, love and devotion for Him becomes stronger Allay any doubts which torment me and help me to see clearly the Divine Light of the truth which radiates from your beloved Son The Saviour of all humanity. Amen.

Go in peace children. Remember when you ask me to pray for you from the heart I, the Mother of Salvation, will present your request to my beloved Son.
I will never ignore one request once it is in line with the wishes of my Son and according to the Holy Will of the Father.

Learn to trust more children. When you trust my Precious Son you demonstrate your love for Him. If your love is weak then your trust in Him will also be weak.
Only those of you who humble themselves before my Son will be blessed with the graces given to strengthen your faith. Never give up when you feel despair.
Despair is created by the Evil One.

Just turn to me and I will pray for peace to return to your soul.

When you do this you will be able to reject temptation placed by the Evil One and you will become free. Your Blessed Mother

Queen of the Angels

Mother of Salvation

Help Me prepare the world for My Second Coming.
