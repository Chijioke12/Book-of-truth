I hold you up. Lean on Me and I will keep you close to My Sacred Heart in these times of terrible torment within the Catholic Church.
Your Beloved Jesus

Monday, May 28th, 2012 @ 20:45

"O my dear Jesus, open my ears to the sound of Your Voice. Open my heart to Your loving call. Fill my soul with the Holy Spirit, so I can recognize You at this time.
I offer You my humble allegiance to all that You ask of me. Help me to discern the Truth, to rise, respond, and follow Your Voice so, I can help You to save the souls of all of humanity.
Your Will is my command. Give me the courage to let You guide me, so I can take up the armor needed to lead Your Church towards Your New Kingdom. Amen."
