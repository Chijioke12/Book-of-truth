My dearly beloved daughter I realise that some of these messages do not make sense to you but you must trust in Me and know that I must reveal the contents of the Book of Revelation so that souls know what to expect in these times.
To those of little faith but who accept My Word, given to you through this prophet, know that your humility and desire, born of a pure love for Me, has brought you closer to My Sacred Heart.

You are the product of the woman who gave birth to a male and who was cast out into the desert where you will be isolated, yet united as one, to proclaim My Holy Word and preach the true Gospels.
The woman gives birth to My true Church, My loyal flock, who will not be misled by the False Prophet.

You, My Church, will be cast aside into the desert for 1,260 days, where you will take refuge. But with the gift of the Holy Spirit you will be fed with the fruits of My love.
It will be the loyal members of My Christian churches, including My sacred servants and those of My followers who reject the False Prophet, who will have to keep My Church together.
You will have to honour Me in secret because the Mass will change beyond recognition under the rule of the False Prophet.
You, are My true followers and all the graces of Heaven are being poured over your precious souls.

How I love you children and how you ease My suffering. But how much pain is in My heart because of those of My followers who will refuse to listen to Me.
They will be drawn in a web by the False Prophet into the darkness and I cannot save them.

By their own will they will slap Me on the face.

My Remnant Church will need to spread the word to My other children including those who do not know Me at all.

You, My Remnant Church, will need to proclaim My prophecies and My Holy Word to those, who are not Christian or who do not know the Ten Commandments.
Your job will be to ensure that the Holy Bible is read and understood.

It will be up to you to inform the world of the full meaning of the seals contained in the Book of Revelation which I will reveal to Maria Divine Mercy.
