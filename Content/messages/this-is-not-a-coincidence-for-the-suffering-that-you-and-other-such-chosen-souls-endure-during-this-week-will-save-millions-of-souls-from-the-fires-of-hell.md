My dearest beloved daughter you must remain brave throughout your suffering and not allow fear to enter your heart. In union, truly with Me, your suffering coincides with the week which commemorates My Death on the Cross.
Just as I endured pain, torture and death to save mankind from eternal damnation so, too, do victim souls save other souls so that they can be given the gift of eternal life.
No matter how difficult and frightening this suffering is always remember the gift to humanity that it represents.

Children, as Holy Week commences please meditate on My Passion on the Cross. Not just on the suffering but on the gift of freedom that it offers the whole of humanity.
Not one soul, including the cruel and hardened sinner influenced by Satan, will be excluded from My Mercy. The mercy, which has been made possible, because of the gift My beloved Father gave the world.
When He sent Me, His one and only Son, He made the biggest sacrifice of all.

This sacrifice, proof of His ardent love for all of His children, has meant that it is possible to destroy Satan once and for all. Because of the free will given to humanity by My Father each man will be given the choice.
You will either be for My Father or against Him.

You will choose either the Paradise of Eternal Life or the horror of Hell.

Satan, as his days are almost at an end will not sit back while My new miracles will be presented to the world at this time.

Not only will he attack those dark souls in order to tempt them into further darkness and closer to his domain, he will target devout Christians.
The miracles I speak of are firstly My communications through you, My daughter. My voice is being heard and conversion is multiplying.
Millions of souls are now being claimed by Me through these messages.

The other miracles include the great gift of My Mercy I bring into the world shortly when The Warning takes place.

For the first time every single man, woman and child will be given the proof that, not only does God the Father exist but that I, Jesus Christ His only Son, also exists.
This means that all those religions, including the Jewish people, My chosen people from whom I came, will realise the truth.

The miracle of global conversion will infuriate Satan who will not give up even at that stage. Those poor souls, already in terrible sin, will find it very difficult to pull away from him.
Other miracles will include global events which will involve ecological wonders which will be given by My Father out of His love for His two witnesses the Christians and the Jews.
Power will be given to these two faiths when they are being persecuted.

Their enemies will suffer as they inflict terrible punishment on them.

And then there will be My Second Coming, the greatest miracle since My resurrection.

This will be the day I come to judge the living and the dead.

This is the day I come to gather My family so that we become one.

This will be the beginning of My reign as Heaven and earth merge to become one for 1,000 years.

At this time all will live by the Divine Will of My Father.

Your beloved Jesus

Let them pray to Me for discernment
Monday, April 2nd, 2012 @ 15:30

My dearest beloved daughter you must rest now for the attacks by those who cannot accept My True Word continues.

You are not permitted to defend My Word but now I am instructing you not to engage with those who doubt My Word for that is not your responsibility.
My daughter no matter how tempting it is to prove the authenticity of My most Holy Word for humanity in these the times, you must not do this.
I never responded to My executioners during My crucifixion. You must not try to respond to those who wish to persecute Me through My Messages.
It is not you my daughter they are angry with; it is I.

I can only tell the world how to prepare for My Second Coming. I cannot force them.

Ignore such taunts. Many are from genuine souls who feel the need to ask questions. But you are not permitted to do so. Let them pray to Me for discernment. Only I have responsibility for their souls. Even when you offer suffering to save souls it is still not your responsibility.
So go and tell those who are in doubt, like My apostle Thomas it was I who faced him after My Resurrection when I stood before him. It was only when he touched My Wounds that he fully believed.
Sadly many souls in the world are not afforded this luxury.

They must know time is short in order to prepare their souls. It is their own free choice whether or not they respond to My Call. Your Jesus

Only through the prayers of intercession can those souls in the dark be saved
Tuesday, April 3rd, 2012 @ 20:00

My dearly beloved daughter there is a period between now and The Warning which I want My followers to understand.

Your intense prayers are needed to save souls who are beyond helping themselves. Many of these souls will not survive The Warning, so it is important that they, and all others who are all in a state of mortal sin, are saved by Divine intervention.
Your prayers, begging for the salvation of their souls, is needed now. This must be your priority now during Holy Week for when you ask My beloved Father, in My Holy Name, to save such sinners; your prayers will be answered.
Crusade Prayer 43 "Save Souls during The Warning"

O God the Almighty Father, on behalf of your beloved Son Jesus Christ and in commemoration of His death on the Cross to save us from our sins, I beg you to save souls who cannot save themselves and who may die in mortal sin during The Warning.
In atonement for the sufferings of Your beloved Son I urge You to forgive those who are unable to seek redemption because they will not live long enough to ask Jesus Your Son for Mercy to free them from sin.
Amen.

Pray for all sinners. My greatest wish is to save all of humanity. Only through the prayers of intercession can those souls in the dark be saved.
Your beloved Jesus Christ

Please say My Divine Mercy and start My Novena on Good Friday
Wednesday, April 4th, 2012 @ 01:00

My dearly beloved daughter the time is almost here for the world to reflect on My Death on the Cross.

This is the time during 2012 that I urgently need your prayers for those who will not recognise Me and for those who do not know about Me.
It will be up to you My beloved followers to help Me save those poor souls whom I need to bring close to My bosom so that I can prepare them for My New Paradise.
Children I need you to say My Divine Mercy chaplet and commence the 9 day Novena of the Divine Mercy from Good Friday.

It is important that as many of you complete this Novena for other souls. You will receive great graces and for this I will never forsake you. I will salvage your soul when you come before Me on the Day of
Judgment.

You must never become tired of praying to save other souls. You are My Army and through the graces I give you, you will work with Me to clean the earth of Sin before My Second Coming.
Praying does not come easy to all of you. The best way is to unite yourself in My Sorrowful Passion and meditate on My suffering and, in particular, My Agony in the Garden. My Great Mercy is at its most
potent then. It was precisely because of sinners, including those Pagans were never given a chance to know Me whom I agonised over the most.
For those of you who love Me know this.

The more you trust in Me completely the stronger is My Mercy. The more I can forgive. My Mercy is so powerful that it can wipe out the sins of all mankind.
Those who believe in Me, trust Me, can achieve great sanctity by helping to save the souls of their brothers and sisters as a priority. They do this out of their love for Me for they know that this brings
Me much consolation.

You, My pure and just followers who love Me so much, know that it is through your generosity of heart that I can save sinners. Sinners, you must understand, are who I died for and are the ones I thirst for most of all. I show great compassion for sinners. But, you My followers who are also sinners must trust in Me completely. By doing this I grant a number of special graces.
The more you ask for My help the more you receive. It is because of this bond that you and I hold between us that you can help Me to save other souls from drowning in despair and hopelessness.
Remember the power of My Divine Mercy Novena and the number of souls you will save for Me this year. Your beloved Jesus

Good Friday is the day I desire, and this year especially, to be remembered for what it really means.
Thursday, April 5th, 2012 @ 08:00

Good Friday is the day I desire, and this year especially, to be remembered for what it really means. My Father sent me into the world and offered Me as a ransom to save the world from the Fires of Hell.
I came to serve you children not to condemn you. My death was a special grace, free of any obligation on your part other than to accept the hand of Mercy given to you by My Eternal Father.
This gift was offered to allow mankind receive the gift of reconciliation so that they can be made fit to enter My Father's Kingdom. Before I was crucified I attended a very important Passover Supper with My Apostles the night before My Death on the Cross.
This Last Supper provides another special gift. The gift of celebrating the Holy Eucharist is a sacrament of love to provide you with a unique gift where you can truly receive Me in Holy Communion.
My true presence, contained in the Holy Eucharist in the world today when celebrated during Holy Mass provides very special graces to those in a state of grace, who love Me, who receive Me.
My presence can be felt in a way which will strengthen your faith when you accept My true presence in the Holy Eucharist.
If you reject My presence in the Holy Eucharist you reject one of the most significant gifts I left behind when I came to earth to atone for your sins.
I died to save you and this is, in itself, a great gift.

But I left you a very special gift where you can receive Me in mind, body and spirit. Accept My presence and your soul will become closer in true union with Me.
Accept Me.
Do not forsake Me.
Do not deny Me.

Believe, without any doubts in your hearts, that it was because of the love of God the Father that these gifts were bestowed upon you.
Reflect now on the real truth of My teachings

Do not accept My Crucifixion without accepting the gifts also offered to you at My Last Supper. If you do you will be starving your soul of the food of life.
Your beloved Jesus Redeemer of Mankind

Easter is a time when My death on the cross is contemplated properly
Friday, April 6th, 2012 @ 22:20

My dearly beloved daughter how you console Me in My time of sorrow. How you give Me the love and comfort I so desire from souls. Oh were all souls to unite and intertwine their hearts with Mine, God's Holy Family would be fully complete. Only when all souls are salvaged will My Father's Divine Will be done.
Easter is a time when My death on the Cross is contemplated properly and My resurrection from the dead is fully acknowledged for the freedom it brings humanity.
My Resurrection means that all of you who love Me and proclaim My Holy Word can also be raised from the dead.

All those who have died in a state of grace and favoured by My Father will also be raised in glory from the dead on the day I come to judge.
They will join those, who are alive not just in body, but in the Spirit of the Lord and be awarded eternal life. Many people do not understand My promise.
All those whose names are contained in the Book of Life will be raised body, mind and soul, free of bodily corruption and in full union with Me.
All those chosen will live according to the Divine Will of My Father.

You will live in love, peace and harmony during my Glorious Reign on earth for 1000 years.

You will join in glory with the first resurrection of the dead. Those souls including your beloved family and friends who are deemed fit to enter My New Paradise on Earth.
This is the life you must all seek out. Let there be no doubt.

For those poor souls who cannot accept the truth of My existence or My promise to judge the living and the dead, they will tear their hair out when faced with the terrible fate which will lie ahead of them when the truth is revealed.
For those believers you must also be careful.

Many of you who do not love Me enough or take Me for granted make the mistake of believing that My mercy ignores sins where no remorse exists.
My mercy is abundant, I want to lavish My graces upon every sinner. But there are those, who are smug in the false assumption, that their knowledge of My teachings is enough to save them.
They are indifferent to My love. They lack a tender heart, have little humility in their souls and believe that certain sins are not worth repenting.
This thinking is dangerous and serves only to remove such souls from Me further.

There is not one sin so small that can be ignored. Absolution can only be given when you repent. You can only repent if you are free from pride and humble of heart.
Rejoice My children this Easter. Just as My Death on the Cross gave you the gift of salvation, it was My resurrection from the dead that will also give you the Eternal Life which has been planned by My Eternal Father for so long.
You have much to look forward to. For the eternal life promised to you means just that. Eternal Life in body, mind and soul.
It is important that you strive for this new life and that you prepare your souls.

Every effort will be made by Satan and his demons to convince you that eternal life in My New Paradise does not exist. That My Second Coming is a lie.
Priests, members of the clergy and devout Christians will be the first target.

Pray, pray, pray to My Eternal Father to protect you with My precious blood so that not one of you strays from the truth Your beloved Jesus Christ
Redeemer of Mankind

I am the Church. The Church was founded by Me and it can never die.
