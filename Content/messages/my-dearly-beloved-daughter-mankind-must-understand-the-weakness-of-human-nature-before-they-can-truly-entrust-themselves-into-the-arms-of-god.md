To those faithful amongst you, your faith and love for Me, your Saviour, brings Me great joy.

But when you say you love Me, this brings with it a great responsibility.

Never forget the weakness in your nature, though no your fault of your own as you were born with original sin, as it can cause you to sin when you are least expecting it.
When the souls of those who say they love Me reach a stage where they are consumed with love for Me that is when they have to be careful. Sometimes this makes them feel elevated in My Eyes, which is true because they are.
But then comes the temptation to see others in a less than flattering light.

They can be tempted to, not just feel compassion for those poor souls who are in darkness or confused but to look down upon them.
Sometimes their strong faith and knowledge of scriptures gives them a false sense of security.

They believe they know everything regarding the teachings of the Church, My Church, My Body on earth.

This is what happened the Pharisees.

They thought they knew everything about the Laws of God. The Love of God.

What they failed to understand was the prophesies, foretold so clearly, about the coming of the Messiah. This meant that they rejected the Christ, the Son of the Living God, when He came as promised.
The cruelty they showed Me, Jesus Christ Son of Man, was in complete contradiction to the love they claimed to have for God. If they truly loved God they would never have treated any child of God as they did.
Their minds were closed to the prophecies given to the world through the prophets, which proclaimed the Truth.

The Truth is that all prophecies will be fulfilled as promised by God.

They rejected The Messiah, promised to provide the future salvation for the whole of humanity.

In turn, through their lies, when they deliberately bribed liars to deny My Resurrection, the Pharisees denied generations of Jews the right to the Truth.
My Death on the Cross wasn't enough for them. They wanted to ensure that no trace existed of Me, the Redeemer of the world afterwards.
They then went back and led God's children into a false faith in which the Truth became a lie.

Remember the prophecies from God are always fulfilled.

My Second Coming is now about to be fulfilled. This time the leaders in the Christian Churches will deny Me like the Pharisees did.
They will torment Me, My prophets, My people and anyone who dares to spread the Truth of My Coming. Do not deny Me this time.
Open your hearts.

Listen carefully to me as I prepare you for the final chapter in the salvation of the world. Your Jesus

If you believe in the existence of Satan then know that everything that is unjust and evil in the world is caused by him

My dearly beloved daughter I am calling out to everyone, young and old, who is unsure about their faith in God.

I appeal to those amongst you, who do believe in Me, but who do not speak with Me, or avail of the Sacraments, or who do not attend their churches, to honour Me.
I love you. I will never desert you and you are going to be given a special Gift shortly.

You will experience what it is like when you will come before me on the Day of Judgement. Then you will forget your doubts.

Many of you, despite your lack of faith, honour Me in so many ways but you do not realise this.

You, in your daily lives, feel love, concern and sympathy for others.

You feel an urge to fight injustice and are repelled when you witness wicked acts, committed by others over those less fortunate than themselves.
You show love for others and look after those who need your help.

You hate to take advantage of others and are sensitive to the needs of those who suffer in this life. You feel love for your family.
You laugh and rejoice when you are with friends and feel a tremendous love and friendship for those close to your heart.

When you marry you feel an overwhelming love for your spouse. Then, when you have children, the love you feel surpasses anything you could ever have imagined.
You cry tears of remorse if and when you hurt someone. You forgive others when they offend you, insult you or cause you harm. Where do you think this love and these emotions come from? Don't you know they can only come from God?
Love is difficult to explain. Difficult to analyse and it can never be proved by science for it is a Gift from God. Hatred , on the other hand, comes from the dark side.
Satan, to many people, may not seem real but he exists.

Many of you do not believe in evil or the existence of evil spirits for they are careful not to reveal themselves. If you believe in the existence of Satan then know that everything that is unjust and evil in the world is caused by him. He is the king of lies and he has the power to blind you to the truth of your existence.
Because of your blindness My Mercy is now going to cover the world to prove to you that I exist.

Be prepared for this day for it will happen soon.

When the signs in the skies are shown to you and witness the clash, the noise and the shaking in the ground know that I have come to waken you up.
When this happens I beg you to turn to Me then for I want to fill you with My Love so I can bring love and joy into your hearts. When My Mercy comes upon you will you feel peace at last.
I love you and I will never forsake you.

I await your response when this great day comes. Your Jesus.

When such souls attack My Holy Word with such venom, this is a sign of Satan's confirmation that these messages are authentic

My dearly beloved daughter there are many of My devoted followers who are plotting a campaign to destroy this mission.

To those who believe that it will be the non-Christians and the atheists who will denounce My Word in these messages then know this.
It will be those who openly proclaim their belief in me, their Jesus, who will hurt Me the most.

They are being clouded by the deceit of the king of lies, who has sent many fallen angels to such souls. Not content with denying My Holy Messages, they will set out to gather as much support as they can amongst My priests to try and sabotage this mission.
Such souls never stop to ask themselves, why they do this. Or why they feel such hatred towards you, My daughter. Or why My Holy Word disturbs them so much.
When such souls attack My Holy Word with such venom, this is a sign of Satan's confirmation that these messages are authentic.

For when such strong opposition is shown and when holy people are provoked to attack Divine messages such as these you can be sure then that they come from God.
When they deny My Word this cuts Me so that I weep with sadness when they don't recognise Me. But that is okay. In time they will know the Truth.
It is when they set out to deliberately drive souls away from My Mercy that they offend Me greatly.

If they are responsible for souls who are denied salvation they will be punished.

Their punishment will be one of wretchedness when they try to defend their actions, for just one lost soul. Their actions can mean that a soul who, would otherwise have been converted, may suffer the final persecution in the fires of Hell.
It is when they try to sabotage the Word of God that their previous good works will be rendered useless. For what good are they when they counteract such worthy deeds with deeds of hatred for God?
I say to them. The day you come before Me to answer for such mean spirited actions will be very difficult for you.

Not only will you have to answer for yourself but you will have to answer for the lies you spread about Me, My Holy Word to others.
Is it your fear of My Holy Word which drives you to such wickedness? Fear comes from Satan. Pride also comes from Satan. Don't you know that it is because you believe that you are so well versed in My Holy Scripture that this cause you to decide that you know more than you do?
You find fault with My Holy Word just as the Pharisees did. By doing so you say that you know more about the Truth than God. Remember that the more you spread lies about My Holy Word you sin against the Word of God.
This sin, against the prophet of the Lord is one of the most frowned upon by My Father.

All those who have sinned against the prophets of the Lord were punished. For when they try to stop the Word of God, given to the world to save souls, they are preventing the salvation of souls.
For this they will be struck down, for nothing will stop the Word of God from being delivered to His precious children.

Your Jesus

This is My last mission on earth where Holy Messages from the Blessed Trinity are being given to the world
