Crusade Prayer (64) Save my brothers and sisters
Wednesday, July 4th, 2012 @ 12:50

"O my dearest Saviour, Jesus Christ, accept my gift of prayer and sacrifices to help save my brothers and sisters from the prison of darkness they are in.
Allow me to help salvage their souls.

I beg You to forgive them, for their sins, and I ask that You flood their souls with the Holy Spirit, so that they will run into Your Arms, as the refuge they so desperately need, before they are lost forever.
I offer You my gift of surrender, for such souls, in humble servitude and thanksgiving. Amen." Children you are one with my Son.
Your love brings Him great comfort and your sacrifices and prayers will help Him to bring all of humanity into the safety of His New Paradise on earth.
Only then can the Holy Family of God the Most High re-unite and live in peace for ever and ever. Your beloved Mother
Mother of Salvation

"O dear Jesus, help me to remain true to Your Most Holy Word, at all times. Give me the strength to uphold the Truth of Your Church in the face of adversity.
Fill me with the grace to administer the Holy Sacraments in the way in which You taught us. Help me to feed Your Church with the Bread of Life and remain loyal to You, even when I am prohibited from doing so.
Free me from the chain of deceit I may face, in order to proclaim the True Word of God.

Cover all Your sacred servants with Your Precious Blood, at this time, so that we will remain courageous, loyal and steadfast, in our allegiance to You, our beloved Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen."
Do not be disheartened My beloved sacred servants for the discord has been prophesised and must come about in the final battle for souls.
I love you and I will be with you now as you walk with Me the thorny road to Calvary so that Salvation can be achieved once more for all souls.
Your Beloved Jesus
