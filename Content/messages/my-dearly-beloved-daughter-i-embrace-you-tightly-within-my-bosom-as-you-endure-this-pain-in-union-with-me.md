My children, and especially My followers, feel a tenderness towards each other which they cannot explain.

They may be strangers living on opposite sides of the world yet the love they feel is My love. They love each other as natural brothers and sisters do in any loving family.
I am the light that creates this spontaneous love which brings souls together.

It is My Holy Spirit which unites all of God's children together as one family.

You, My children, are My family.

The Holy Trinity heads up the family and, when your love is pure and humble, you are automatically part of this holy family.

Love of the Father is through Me.

When you love Me I will take you into the arms of My Father who will place the seal of protection around you and your family.
*(see seal of protection crusade prayer 33)

My heart is tender as I witness with joy, the love that you have for each other.

You bring Me such comfort from the torment that I have to endure as My poor children in war torn countries are being persecuted.
Unite with Me now so that My family of devoted followers will join as one, no matter what their background is or what country they come from, in order to conquer the hatred in the world.
Love is more powerful than hatred.

Hatred is diluted if it is responded to with love.

If someone treats you unjustly you must respond with love and satan will cower in pain.

If you feel tempted to seek revenge on those who hurt you then you must pray for them, forgive them and show them love instead. Love, which permeates through My family on earth, is a very powerful force.
You must never believe, for one instant, that hatred can defeat love.

The power that hatred wields, although ugly and painful to witness, can be defeated through the power of love. How can love weaken hatred in the world today? Prayer is the answer.
Love Me.

Listen to Me.

Respond to the requests of My beloved Mother and Me, her Son, through the various prayers given to you.

Here is a special crusade prayer for the unification of God's children.

It will spread love in the every corner of the earth and dispel the hatred that grows every day.

This hatred, caused by satan through the weakness of humanity, and which creates atrocities such as torture, murder, abortion and suicide can be averted through this
Crusade Prayer number 37 for the unification of all God's children

O dear Jesus

Unite all your beloved followers in love

So that we can spread the truth of your promise For eternal salvation throughout the whole world

We pray that those lukewarm souls

Afraid of offering themselves to you in mind, body and soul

Will drop their armour of pride and open their hearts to your love And become part of your holy family on earth

Embrace all those lost souls dear Jesus

And allow our love, as their brothers and sisters

To lift them from the wilderness and take them with us Into the bosom, love and light of the Holy Trinity

We place all our hope, trust and love in your holy hands

We beg you to expand our devotion so that we can help save more souls Amen.

I love you children.

You must never feel disheartened when you see the wickedness around you.

Your prayers can dilute this wickedness. Your love will defeat it.
Your loving Saviour Jesus Christ

Same sex marriage a grave sin
Friday, March 16th, 2012 @ 22:20

My dearly beloved daughter, the pain and suffering of my poor followers who have to watch, helplessly, as new laws, contrary to My teachings, are reaching unprecedented levels in the world.
Not only do you have to witness sin, children you then have to watch as sin is presented to you where you are forced to accept it as bein,g humane.
I refer to one sin in particular, same sex marriage, which is presented as a natural right.

You are then expected to accept this abomination as it is set before My Father's Throne in a church.

It is not enough for these people to condone same sex marriage in the eyes of the law they then want to force God the Father to give them His blessing. He could never do this because it is a grave sin in His eyes.
How dare these people think it is acceptable to parade this abominable act in My Father's Churches? Children, I love every soul.
I love sinners.

I detest their sin but love the sinner.

Same sex sexual acts are not acceptable in My Father's Eyes.

Pray for these souls because I love them but cannot give them the graces they desire.

They must know, that no matter how much they try to condone same sex marriages, they are not entitled to participate in the Holy Sacrament of marriage.
A Sacrament must come from God. The rules for receiving Sacraments must stem from My Father's Teachings.

You cannot force My Father, God the Most High, to give His blessing, or access to, His holy Sacraments unless they are respected in the way they are meant to be.
Sin is now presented in the world as a good thing. As I have said before the world is back to front.
Good is presented as evil and those people who try to live by the laws of God the Father are sneered at. Evil, no matter how you dress it up, cannot be turned into an act of goodness in the Eyes of My Father.
My Father will punish those who continue to flaunt their sins before Him.

Heed this warning, for your sins, which are carried out when you refuse to obey God, will not and cannot be forgiven. This is because you refuse to accept sin for what it is.
Your Saviour Jesus Christ.

I will come in the clouds surrounded by all the angels and the saints in Heaven
