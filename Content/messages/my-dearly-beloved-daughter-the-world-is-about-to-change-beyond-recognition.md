For My time is almost here now.

I urge all those believers in Me, their Divine Saviour and My Eternal Father to stop what you are doing and listen. Whether or not you believe in these, My messages to the world for these times, hear now my urgent plea.
Pray, pray and pray with all the love you hold in your heart for Me, for the souls of atheists.

Many will die during The Warning.

Many will not get a chance to repent in time.

I urge you to offer up all your suffering and prayers for those souls so that I can save them from the fires of hell. Pray for those who will not turn back to Me even when the truth is presented to them.
Pray also for those who will find the purgatory on earth, the penance which will be accepted by them with good heart to be very difficult.
Many will find it very painful.

Pray that they receive the strength they need to persevere.

Go children and do everything I have asked of you for there is little time left. I love you. Remember there is nothing to fear if you love Me.
Just pray for those who reject Me now today and those will turn their backs on the truth. Your beloved Saviour
Jesus Christ

Good News - God, My Eternal Father, has sanctioned the salvation of much of mankind.
