---

The rage of Satan, against these Messages, will increase quickly and every effort will be made to denounce you, My daughter.
Suffering is to be accepted by you, because of your surrender to My Holy Will, which is of your own accord. So you, My daughter, must remain silent as the screams of the beast and those poor souls he uses to attack you continue. I say this to all of My beloved loyal disciples - remain firm. Keep your heads bowed in humble servitude and offer your suffering for those souls who will not accept the Gift of Truth.
Those responsible for infiltrating My Church on earth chose the time of Lent, deliberately, to insult Me, their Jesus, who died in agony to save their souls.
So infested are they, those who roam the corridors of Rome, that the biggest sign will be seen in the chaos, which will ensue, as they adhere to the command of the imposter. Chaos, disorder, division and contradiction will be seen everywhere in Rome. This disorder comes from Satan for it cannot come from God.
Anger comes from the evil one and his rage is palpable when My Light spreads amongst God's children. Make it known that when attacks of such a vicious nature are inflicted on another, in My Name, that it is My Presence which provokes such a reaction.
Only I, Jesus Christ, and My followers can be the focus of such abuse and so, when you find that this becomes unbearable, please say this short prayer:
"I share this pain with You, dear Jesus, and ask that You bless my enemies, and those who scourge You, with the Gift of the Holy Spirit. Amen."
The discord will continue and My Agony is felt by all the saints and angels in Heaven, for the time of the Apocalypse is near.

Hold onto Me, your Jesus, and place all your trust in Me as I build My Remnant Army, in preparation for the ugly battle for souls which lies ahead.
Your Jesus

The Third Seal will be revealed when man will scramble for food as famines grip humanity
Saturday, March 16th, 2013 @ 15:25

My dearly beloved daughter, the tides will unleash and the destruction, caused by many wars, will commence as foretold.

The timing of the arrival of the false prophet will coincide with the declaration of wars all over the world. These wars will be triggered instantly and men will cower in fear as the implications become clear. Wars will take root and roll out like storms in the desert, where they will gain momentum and catch all of those who feel that their peace is guaranteed, like a thief in the night.
So many countries will be involved that it will take everyone by surprise. Soon the antichrist will make himself known in the midst of the carnage. Confusion, fear and loss of crops will compound the problem. Not long after, the Third Seal will be revealed when man will scramble for food as famines grip humanity. Starved of food, starved of spirit, starved of help, mankind will grasp at anything or anyone, which offers respite.
The stage will have been set for the antichrist to arrive and announce himself to the world. By this time, mankind will be so relieved because of the man of peace, who offers so much hope, that they will become his willing slaves. They will fall for his elaborate plan to restructure the world and bring all nations together. The plan, they will be told, will be for the good of all and to rid the world of terrorism. The enemies, he will say he fights, and whom he will exert control over, are innocent victims used by him in the deceit, which he will present to the world.
When peace, or what seems like a truce, is restored, then will come the next stage, the unity of all nations, all religions, all countries, into one. This is when the union between the false prophet and the antichrist will become clear.
Those who will have been given the Truth, and whose names are in the Book of the Living, will know what is happening. Others, blind to the Truth of My Teachings, will not be so fortunate. Then it will be a matter of waiting. My Patience will mean that I will strive to save and protect those who will not be able to discern the Truth.
My Patience and My Mercy will result in Divine Intervention on a grand scale to save all God's children from the grasp of the beast, whose only objective is to encourage sin. For there is one thing you must know; behind the charming allure of the antichrist will lie the plan to encourage sin, so that humanity will make the final choice - to side with the beast in defiance of God. When that time comes and after every attempt is made by Me to save souls it will be over.
Only the elect will be taken into My Kingdom. Your Jesus

A message for priests and all those sacred servants of Mine who have given their lives to My Sacred Service.
Sunday, March 17th, 2013 @ 18:50

My dearly beloved daughter, this is a Message for priests and all those sacred servants of Mine who have given their lives to My Sacred Service.
My beloved servants, I desire that you obey the Laws of the Church and those to whom you must show obedience in My Holy Name.
You must never desert your duties to the Church and you must continue to serve Me as always. Please administer all the Sacraments, as before, but with even more diligence. Attend, as always, to your sacred duties. Your duty is to God's children and you must guide your flock. Remain loyal to My Teachings at all times.
It will not be you, My precious servants, who will desert My Church on earth. It will not be through your doing that Laws within My Church will be changed in order to embrace new doctrines.
You will remain loyal to the services of My Church and conduct your duties until the terrible day. This will be the day when My Holy Mass will be changed beyond recognition. It will be the enemies of God, who have infiltrated My Church on earth, who will push you away from Me.
When they present the new Mass, you will be left with no choice then, for you will know that it will no longer offer the Most Holy Eucharist. It will be then that the Truth will finally be revealed to you, although you will be aware of the signs before then.
The signs will include strange new ways of adjusting prayers; Satan will no longer be denounced and the Sacraments will be tampered with in order to include other denominations. You will become uneasy, yet you will feel an obligation to remain loyal to My Church.
It will be then that the Existence of My Church on earth will be your only means of survival if you are to remain loyal to My Teachings. When My Teachings, My Sacraments and My Holy Mass are changed, you must not be deceived. If you do not adhere to My Laws, then you will betray Me.
For other Christian churches, I warn you that this infestation will spread also to your churches. In time, it will become difficult for you to honour My Teachings in the way they were given to the world. All Christians will suffer under the regime of the false prophet and his cohort, the antichrist, whose face will be beamed all over the world soon, as the most influential leader of all time.
Your Jesus

Mother of God: The division in the world, to be brought about by Gog and Magog, will split families in two
Monday, March 18th, 2013 @ 19:35

My child, you must never doubt the importance of this Mission or allow attacks on you to divert your attention from my beloved Son.
It is because of my Son's Love and Mercy that He reveals to the world the plans by the evil one to snatch souls before the time of the end. This devious plan has been devised for a very long time and will be inflicted on God's children by Masonic forces whose allegiance is to the evil one.
Let no one be in any doubt as to the prophecies revealed by me, your Mother, to visionaries and seers throughout the centuries. Children, you must not be frightened. Instead you should be hopeful and rejoice for the time for the New Heaven and New Earth is soon and God's children will finally be rid of the evil, which each one of you has borne witness to throughout your lives.
This time has been foretold in my Father's Book, and because of this, you must accept the Truth of the contents of the Book of Revelation. If you do not accept the Book of Revelation, given to John, then you cannot say you accept the rest of the Book - the Most Holy Bible.
Much of what is to come will be difficult and hurtful, for the division in the world to be brought about by Gog and Magog will split families in two. The evil scheming and the deceitful plans, devised by the false prophet and the antichrist, will be the greatest deception since the Pharisees denied my Son. When they, the Pharisees, denied my Son, they prevented the Truth from being given to God's children. This reduced the numbers and the followers of my Son, during His time on earth, and prevented them from becoming Christians. The same will be true of these two who will bear the image of goodness, but who will lead many of God's children astray. They will blind many to the Truth as the sweeping changes, which they will bring about, throughout their reign, will detach people from the Laws of God.
God's children will be told that evil is acceptable and that certain sins are not offensive to God. People will believe them and, as a result, will turn their backs on God.
Pray, pray, pray that their reign will be short and that the Truth will prevail so that my Son's Church on earth can remain intact. Your beloved Mother
Mother of Salvation

Layer by layer, their evil intents will become clear as they trip themselves up
Tuesday, March 19th, 2013 @ 22:45

My dearly beloved daughter, My Holy Word spreads like a powerful wind across the whole world, at this time, through these Messages.
Many will hear My Voice, whether they wish to do so, or not, for It will sound like thunder before the storm. Some will recognise the Holy Spirit as It engulfs their souls. Others, unfortunately, will not, but I say this to them. You have heard My Voice. It has stirred your soul and, yet, you block Me. Yet, you turn your back. You may fear My Voice, as It can be overwhelming, but the one thing you cannot do is to ignore Me.
So powerful is My Holy Spirit that It will touch your soul, whether you wish this to be or not. To those of you who run, hide and pretend that I Am not Present, you should know that you will be unable to deny My Presence, no matter how hard you try.
Some of you will resist the Truth as you lack faith in My Promise to offer you eternal life. Many of you find this frightening and would prefer to think that the Great Day of the Lord will not take place in your lifetime. And so you close your eyes, block your ears and seek solace in other things.
The security you feel in trying to find peace, where it can be found, will be short lived. Soon you will be denied the Word of God. Words you have been used to hearing will disappear from the homilies and the letters from your bishops and cardinals, delivered to you and all those unsuspecting followers of Mine.
Masonic sects infiltrate the Church in Rome. Make no mistake - there can only be one pope in one lifetime.

Many of My followers will now reject My Holy Word, the Truth, just as they did during My trial on earth. You, My daughter, will be rejected as a heretic, sneered at and mocked. You will become a thorn in the side of the false prophet. But soon, all will see the subtle acts and the sly gestures of those false imposters who preside over My Throne in Rome, for they amount to sacrilege.
Layer by layer, their evil intents will become clear as they trip themselves up and those, blessed with the insight bestowed upon them by Me, will realise the abomination, which is unravelling.
The beast is now ready and forms a secular circle, comprised of some of the world's leaders, as one in union with all that is against the Kingdom of God. Demonic spirits, who invade these poor souls, will, because of their pride and arrogance, show themselves for all to see through their gestures, which will be scrutinised and questioned until the final answers will dawn on those blessed with the Gift of Discernment.
Trust in Me. Trust in this Gift of Trust. Let Me hold you and guide you through this jungle of evil creatures who wish to devour your souls.
Your Jesus

Just as the blind cannot see, there will be those amongst the Church in Rome who can see, but who will refuse to acknowledge the Truth
Wednesday, March 20th, 2013 @ 19:15

My dearly beloved daughter, My Crucifixion is being relived all over again and each part is connected to the time in the lead up to My Second Coming.
Now that My Body - My Church - has endured the scourging, for so many years, because of the spirit of evil, the Crowning of Thorns is now being inflicted on the leadership within My Church.
When the third thorn pierced My Right Eye, I could no longer see through It. Only through My other Eye could I see the terrible pain, which was experienced by My Mother. Now that the Crown of Thorns pierces the Head of My Church in Rome, only one-half will bear witness to the Truth of the prophecies foretold. The other half will be blinded and will fail to see the damage, which is to be meted out upon every part of My Body - My Church - in every nation in the world.
Just as the blind cannot see, there will be those amongst the Church in Rome who can see, but who will refuse to acknowledge the Truth. So painful will the Truth be, that it will be easier for these sacred servants of Mine to take the easy path.
Cowards, they will choose the path of desecration rather than take up their cross for Me.

Then there will be those who love Me and this division will not deter them in the plan to help Me salvage souls from certain death. These brave souls, filled with the grace of the Spirit of Fire, will fight to preserve My Most Holy Sacraments. These are the clergy who will feed My flock during the persecution. Every grace will be granted to such pure souls and they will, in turn, lead My remnant army, to the gates of the New Heaven and the New Earth.
It takes great courage to accept the Word of God's prophets. It is never easy to hear the Words of the prophets, whose Words cut to their heart of souls, like a double-edged sword. Their warnings are painful to hear, but sweet because of the fruits they yield, for when the Word of God is given as a Gift, it offers salvation. Grasp My Holy Word, as It is your lifeline. You, My beloved followers, are protected by the Seal of the Living God and so you must never fear.
Your enemies will scold you, insult you, and may persecute you, but it will be I, Jesus Christ, Who will walk with you. You, My chosen few, who respond to My Call, through your suffering, will redeem much of humanity, in My Eyes.
I bless you. I give you peace and strength, so that you can follow Me without fear in your hearts. Your Jesus

The time for the division is soon and you must prepare
Thursday, March 21st, 2013 @ 20:00

My dearly beloved daughter, how My Heart breaks because of the sorrow, which is being felt by souls who are in disarray because of the flight of My last pope, My beloved Benedict.
You, My cherished souls, feel so confused and, somewhat, alone. I feel your pain and you must pray hard for My Hand of Mercy, so that I can reach out to comfort your sorrowful hearts.
This will be a time of betrayal for you, My daughter, as many of those who have sided with this Holy Mission will walk away. You must increase the time you spend in Eucharistic Adoration to seven days a week and only then will you be able to walk alone and without fear, to complete the tasks, which I will give you, many of which will be extremely difficult.
You must stay strong, all of you, at this time. You must not listen to those voices of condemnation, which will grate on your nerves and which will increase in great quantities as Holy Week arrives.
Every slander, every lie, every wicked objection to these, My Holy Messages for the world, will be your cross to bear for the next ten days. Not for one moment will you be allowed, My followers, to rest, to pray, or to contemplate upon My Most Holy Word.
Be aware that without the protection of the Holy Rosary, which must be said daily, that you will leave yourselves open to doubts, which do not come from Me.
The time for the division is soon and you must prepare. I wish to give you a special grace to help you to withstand the persecution and the pressures, which will be placed upon you, to encourage you to withdraw from My Messages. It will take great faith, trust and nerves of steel, to focus on My Holy Word, and so, you must say this Crusade Prayer, once a day, from now on.
Crusade Prayer (102) To sustain faith and belief in God's Message for the world

Dearest Jesus, when I am down, lift me up. When I doubt, enlighten me.
When I am in sorrow, show me Your Love. When I criticise, help me to remain silent. When I judge another in public, seal my lips.
When I utter blasphemies, in Your Name, redeem me and bring me back into Your protection. When I lack courage, give me the sword I need to do battle and save the souls You desire.
When I resist Your Love help me to surrender and abandon myself, completely, within Your Loving care. When I wander away, help me to find the Path of Truth.
When I question Your Word, give me the answers I seek.

Help me to be patient, loving and kind, even to those who curse You.

Help me to forgive those who offend me and give me the grace I need to follow You to the ends of the earth. Amen.

Go, My precious followers, and remember that your duty is to Me, your Church and My Teachings. Take the Sword of Salvation and with it fight with Me to take every single soul, including those who sin against Me, into My Kingdom.
Your Jesus

I desire that all of My followers conduct a time of fasting from next Monday until 15:30 hours on Good Friday
Friday, March 22nd, 2013 @ 21:45

My dearly beloved daughter, I desire that all of My followers conduct a time of fasting from next Monday until 15:30 hours (03:30 PM) on Good Friday.
Even a small token of fasting will glean, for all of you, an insight into My Plan of Salvation and how you can help Me to salvage the souls of all sinners.
It is through fasting that you will become whole again. By cleansing your body, your spirit will be renewed. I also desire that you receive the Sacrament of Confession, or what form of reconciliation is available to you. Please, if you are unable to receive this Sacrament then accept the Gift I have given you of My Plenary Indulgence some time ago.
(Tuesday, January 31st, 2012 @ 09:30 PM

You must say this prayer for seven consecutive days to be given the gift of total absolution and the Power of the Holy Spirit.

"O my Jesus, You are the Light of the earth  . You are the Flame that touches all souls.	Your Mercy and Love knows no bounds.
  We are not worthy of the Sacrifice You made by Your death on the Cross . Yet we know that Your Love for us is greater than the love we hold for You.	Grant us, O Lord, the gift of humility, so that we are deserving of Your New Kingdom.	Fill us with the Holy Spirit, so we can march forth and lead Your army	to proclaim the Truth of Your Holy Word and prepare our brothers and sisters	for the Glory of Your Second Coming on earth . We honour You . We praise You . We offer ourselves, our sorrows, our sufferings, as a gift to You to save souls.	We love You, Jesus.	Have Mercy on all Your children wherever they may be.
Amen.")

Then in spirit, I wish you to join with Me, as if you were present with My apostles at My Last Supper. You will share with Me, the unleavened bread and eat with Me at My table. You, My followers, can share with Me, My Cup of Suffering, by your own free will, should you accept My offer.
If you can accept this, you will, in atonement for the sins of mortal man, save millions of souls. I will grant Mercy to the most hardened sinners, in return for your gift of suffering.
Here is the Crusade Prayer for you if you wish to share My Cup of Suffering. Recite this, three times, when you can, but preferably during any time of fasting.
Crusade Prayer (103) To share the Cup of Suffering with Christ

I lay before You, dear Jesus, and at Your Feet to do what You will with me for the good of all. Let me share Your Cup of Suffering.
Take this gift from me, so that You can save those poor souls who are lost and without hope. Take me, in body, so I can share Your Pain.
Hold my heart in Your Sacred Hands and bring my soul in union with You.

Through my gift of suffering, I allow Your Divine Presence to embrace my soul, so that You can redeem all sinners and unite all God's children forever and ever. Amen.
This sacrifice on your part, presented to Me, Jesus Christ, Redeemer of all humanity, will enable Me to pour My Great Mercy over the whole world.
More importantly, I will save even those who hate Me. Your prayers and sacrifice are their only saving grace, for without this, they would be destroyed by the evil one.
If you do not wish to endure this suffering, I will grant you great blessings and ask that you continue with Me on My journey to awaken the world from its slumber and so I can lift the veil of deceit which covers it.
Your Jesus

Mother of God: my Son's Body was torn to shreds
Saturday, March 23rd, 2013 @ 23:45

My child, many do not understand my role as Co-Redemptrix. Nor do they know why this is so.

When I accepted the call to become the Mother of God, I was bound to the Covenant of God's Salvation for humanity.

When I bore my Son, I felt the same love, which any mother would have for their child. This pure, beautiful little boy was part of me, my own flesh and blood. Yet, I was also aware that He was not just any child. His Spirit entered my soul as soon as I set eyes on Him. He and I were entwined as one, where I felt every Emotion, Joy, Pain and the Love, which coursed through Him. I also knew that He was Divine and that I was, as such, merely His servant, although He never made me feel like so.
As a baby, he would lay His Divine Head close to my chest and murmur words of Love with such emotion that it would fill my Heart and I felt like it would burst with happiness. He, this little child of mine, became all that I lived for. Every touch filled me with such unbelievable tenderness and joy. All those who saw Him, even as a baby, would tell me how special He was. His piercing Eyes would stir their souls and many did not know why.
This special bond between me and my beloved Son could never be broken. I knew that I had been born only so that I could become His Mother. This role was the only reason for my being.
And so, to His every need I responded, and He, with such Love and Compassion, put all my needs before His. His desires were always met by me, His Mother, His humble servant.
When He was not believed to be the Son of man, when He proclaimed the Truth and did as His Father desired, I cried bitter tears. How it tore me apart when I had to witness His persecution.
I endured His pain, not just as any mother would - were they to see pain inflicted on their child - His pain became mine, and mine, His.
They forced Him to walk, hands bound in front with ropes around His Waist, which meant He could walk - only with a shuffle, and a little at a time. While the Cross was thrown upon His torn and shattered Body, my pain was so excruciating, that I fainted continuously.
My pain was not just physical; my sorrow pierced my Heart and tore it into two. To this day, my Heart is entwined with that of my Son, and so, during Holy Week, I relive the pain, torment and persecution with my Son all over again.
Children, to explain the savagery inflicted upon my Son would be impossible for you to fathom; so vicious was the scourging. My Son's Body was torn to shreds.
Never forget that He was the Son of man, sent to redeem every soul on earth, including those alive in the world today. He died in terrible agony, in order to save each and every one of you today. His Suffering did not end on Calvary. It will still be endured, by Him, until the Great Day of His Second Coming.
Those who ignore these warnings from Heaven are free to do so. They will not be judged because of this rejection. But, as they move further away from the Truth of these revelations from Heaven, they will be tempted into sin. The sins which they will be tempted with, will be those which will be declared no longer to be sin by those enemies in my Son's Church on earth.
Thank you, children, for opening your minds, your hearts and souls to this call from Heaven, sent to you because of the Love, which God holds for all of His children.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

My Mission is not to give you a new Bible, for that could never be, as My Father's Book contains the whole Truth
Sunday, March 24th, 2013 @ 18:06

My dearly beloved daughter, when you are asked by those who love Me, what is the purpose of your Mission, your answer must be - to save your souls.When you are sneered at, mocked and asked what gives you the right to proclaim the Word of God - the answer is, so that Jesus can save your souls. Then, when those who do proclaim My Holy Word already, and who follow My Teachings, accuse you of heresy - then the answer to them is this. You, who are faithful to Christ, do you not think that you, too, are sinners in the Eyes of God? Don't you, too, want to salvage your souls?
Sin will always stand between you and God. Every single soul, including the most hardened sinner and those amongst you who are chosen souls, will never be free from sin, until I come again. You may be redeemed every time you confess your sins, but your soul will remained cleansed for only a short time.
Never feel you are not in need of the Food of Life. My Light draws you, now, to Me, through this very special Mission. I give you great blessings and special graces when you respond to My call, as I beckon you towards My New Kingdom - My New Paradise.
You may believe that God would not need to send another prophet - that mankind was released from the stranglehold of Satan, after My death on the Cross, that you have been given the Truth through My Teachings already, and that the Truth is contained in My Father's Book, the most Holy Bible. And you would be correct, but for this. There is still more you have to know as the prophecies contained in the Book of Revelation are not known to you. You have been given the summary - and yet many of you refuse to acknowledge its contents. You snub the Book of Revelation and have no wish to understand it.
My Mission is not to give you a new Bible, for that could never be, as My Father's Book contains the whole Truth. My Task, in a world, which has plunged into paganism, is to remind you of the Truth on the one hand, and on the other, is My Desire to prepare your souls, for the time of My Second Coming.
Many of you say you honour Me, but many have fallen away from the Truth. Many do not believe in Satan or the existence of Hell, and as such, do not take sin seriously. You have been led into grave error through your tolerance for sin. And now the gravest errors will come about, throughout all Christian Churches, when sin will be cast to one side. You will be led into a doctrine of deceit. This is a plan crafted by the Evil One to take you away from Me.
Because My Divine Presence, My Body and My Blood, is contained in every Tabernacle in the world - you have been able to fight sin. But now, when the plan to remove the Holy Eucharist comes about, you will be helpless.
This is why I reveal to you the Truth of what is to come, so that I can prepare you. It is only because I Love you that I call out to you now.
When the errors are exposed, you will then realise how much you have to learn and how pride prevented you from accepting My Hand of Mercy and how you are nothing without Me.
Your Jesus

The greatest horror I witnessed in My Time in the Garden of Olives was the scourge of sin in the time of the end
Monday, March 25th, 2013 @ 14:50

My dearly beloved daughter, the greatest horror I witnessed in My time in the Garden of Olives was the scourge of sin in the time of the end. During the vision, shown to Me by Satan, I saw the fall away of mortal man from God's Laws. He, the evil one, showed Me terrible images; tempted Me with every reason why I should turn away from the Will of My Father. He wanted to torment Me and so he displayed the power he would still have, despite My death on the Cross.
I was shown the final destruction of My Church on earth; the seizure of power within it by masonic sects; the immorality of man; the lack of shame on the part of God's children, as they engaged in vile sins of the flesh; the murder of innocents and the falling into error by those who profess to speak in My Name.
So powerful is Satan that he planted doubts in My Mind about My being the Son of man. I, in My Divinity, could not succumb to sin but I tell you this, so that humanity can understand how evil can tempt you to turn away from Me.
Satan does not present evil in the most obvious ways. Instead he disguises evil as good. He is cunning and can trick even the most holy amongst you, into believing that a lie is the Truth.
As people fall away from My Teachings they will embrace sin willingly and with greed in their hearts. Without direction they will always fall from grace. When My Name is being wiped off the face of the earth, man will be unable to find God.
Whatever religion you follow it does not matter because your only route to God is through Me, His only Son. Because of My death on the Cross, I saved you - including every man, woman and child alive in the world today- from the fires of Hell. If you do not accept this then you cannot enter the Gates of Paradise. It is only through the Son that you can be presented to the Father.
Reject Me, Jesus Christ, and you reject your salvation.

How little you have learned about sin and the way in which it separates you from God. The spread of sin has never been so rampant since God created the world. You sinners have reached new depths, which disgust Me. You have exposed even the little ones, who were entrusted into your care, to behave like demons. You lack charity, love and compassion for one another and yet many of you display your acts of faith for the world to see and admire. Just as the Pharisees dictated the Laws of God, but did not practice them, nor did they show humility, so too, will those of you who say you come in My Name cave in to the sin of pride.
So much do you still need to learn about My Voice and My Teachings, which still fall on deaf ears. Then there are those who spend all their time proclaiming their knowledge of God, say they know the prophecies, which have still to be revealed, but know nothing. Were it not for My great Mercy you would be unfit to enter My Kingdom.
The time has come for all those who claim to guide God's children, in the ways of the Lord, to beg Me, Jesus Christ, for the Gift of Humility. It is time for you to listen to the Truth, as it was given to you, for you don't have much time to redeem yourselves in My Eyes.
Your Jesus

You must keep your eyes open to anything, which insults My Divinity
Tuesday, March 26th, 2013 @ 21:17

My dearly beloved daughter, this Message is for the world. It is for Christians of every denomination, the Jews and all those religions who proclaim My Almighty Father, God the Most High.
This Message is also for those who do not believe in God the Father, or Me, His only begotten Son. It is also for those who could not care less what life lies ahead and whose indifference means that they cannot accept the Existence of God.
Through these Messages you are being warned of the danger to your future life and your wellbeing, so that I can bring all of you into the New Paradise, which was created for you when Heaven and Earth will merge as one. This Kingdom is complete and the Gates will be open to each of you. This beautiful Gift, where you will live in perfect body, mind and soul comes from God the Almighty One, Who created the world.
The time for your exile on earth is almost over. No longer will you have to endure the pain of sin, which creates havoc in every part of the world. Hatred, which is kept alive through the infestation of Satan in the world, will no longer exist. When hatred has been banished, evil will no longer sully the perfect Creation of God. His Planet, His Gifts of Nature, His Protection and His Love will be renewed to give you a life of eternity where no death is possible.
Life on earth, as it is now, will never satisfy you while Satan reigns. His reign is already at an end, but those he infests will carry on spreading sin by sucking the innocent, and not so innocent, souls into the depths of despair. This infestation will continue until as many souls as possible are taken and presented to the beast who will devour them.
I will come soon, finally, as prophesised the second time, to bring you final salvation and to present to you the Key to My Promised Kingdom. My Kingdom will descend from the skies for the world to see before the final trumpet sounds. When the trumpets peal, only those who allowed Me to salvage them and those true to the Word of God will be taken. This is why you must not allow pride to blind you to the Call of God at this time. This Mission was prepared from the very first prophecies given to the human race by God. Be thankful that, by the Mercy of God, that you have been given this Great Gift. Never allow pride to blind you to My Divine Presence, for that is what will separate you from My Mercy.
I prepare you now, only so that I can save all humanity and not just the elect who serve Me with great humility. I want all of you, no matter what you believe. My Father has planned this Mission in order to open your hearts so that you can be shown the Truth in time, before the Great Day when I come to Judge.
The Gift of the Holy Spirit continues to be poured over this Mission and cover all souls - especially those who stubbornly turn their backs on Me. The battle for souls is between My Kingdom and the terrible abyss over which the beast rules. You must keep your eyes open to anything, which insults My Divinity. It does not matter where those insults spring from, but you must never accept them in My Holy Name.
Now is the time of great deceit and I urge you to pray to God for the wisdom to understand what truly comes from Me and what does not.
Your Jesus

Your transition from this earth into My New Kingdom will be painless, instant and will be so sudden that you will barely be able to take a breath

My dearly beloved daughter, come all of you and join with Me in remembrance of the day when you were given the great Gift of Redemption.
Good Friday must be remembered as the day when the Gates of Paradise were finally opened to welcome God's children from their exile from Him. My death secured for you a future you would never have, had My Father not sent Me as the Messiah.
My Body was crucified but My death brought you life. In this, the time for My Second Coming, My Body will endure the same Crucifixion - only this time it will be My Church, My Mystical Body, which will suffer. You must know that I would never allow the crucifixion of My Church to destroy the faith of God's children. So now, I call on every person, every creed, every colour and every race to listen to Me.
You will soon experience all the signs on earth, which will prove to you that you are the Creation of God. You will know soon that you will never die if you call out to God's Mercy. The future for all of you, who accept that you are a cherished child of God, is bright. I invite you, your family and friends to join in My Kingdom and eat from My Table.
Your transition from this earth into My New Kingdom will be painless, instant and will be so sudden that you will barely be able to take a breath before its beauty is revealed to you. Please do not fear My Second Coming, if you love God. God loves you. I love you. The Holy Trinity will embrace the earth and all those, who accept My Hand of Mercy and who show remorse for their sinful lives, will be safe.
The strong in faith, amongst you, will be taken swiftly. The time for those who lag behind, lacking in faith and who find it impossible to reach out to Me, will be longer.
You, My faithful followers will have to help the weak and those who are lost. My Mercy is so great that I will give all those souls the time needed to take them into the eternal life I have promised all. Never feel downhearted when all seems hopeless, as sin continues to devour the souls of the weak. We must work, in union, to save those who are so far removed from Me that very little will entice them into My Arms. Through your love for each other, miracles will be used to convert those lost souls. This is My Promise to you. Prayer, and much of it, will be part of your duty to Me to save those souls from the terrible end, which is being planned by Satan against God's children who he detests. He must not be given these souls.
My Call is for everyone. These Messages do not exclude any religion. Instead they are given to each child of God with great Love, as you are all equal in His Eyes.
Be at peace and trust in the Love of God.
