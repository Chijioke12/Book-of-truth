My dearly beloved daughter tell My children that this time of Lent is a time of quiet reflection, of personal sacrifice and an opportunity to pray for the mitigation of war in the world.

Fasting is important for your souls. It cleanses the spirit and gives Me great comfort.

You can save many souls by fasting just once a week.

This can be according to your desire. All that matters is that you offer up this day for souls. Use this time to help Me in My battle for souls.
Reflect on My life on earth and the gift I bestowed, by My death on the cross, to provide all of My children with Eternal Life. These few weeks of Lent must be used to prepare your souls and those of your brothers and sisters.
Please prepare for Holy Week and Easter by reciting this Crusade Prayer (34) My Gift of Fasting to Jesus
