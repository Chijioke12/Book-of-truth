However, I will not stand back and watch My Church, by the hand of one particular sect who has no right to play a role in the Holy See, to disintegrate.
For that is precisely what the False Prophet and the imposters who idolise Satan are trying to do. They want to topple the Catholic Church and break it into little pieces.
This, My children, is how Satan will stand in final rebellion against God, the creator of all things.

This wicked plan to destroy My Church has been underway for 100 years but, since 1967, it has intensified.

Many imposters, who are members of this evil sect, who worship Satan, entered the seminaries to gain a foothold in the Vatican.
Their powers, while allowed by God the Father, were restricted up to now. As the end times draw nearer that will change.

This evil sect will now unleash every power to ensure that they will elect a new replacement for My Holy Vicar Pope Benedict XVI.
All those who know My teachings will see changes in the recital of the Holy Mass.

New secular laws will be introduced which will be an affront to My Death on the Cross.

Many devout followers of Mine will see this and will feel hurt. Their views will be dismissed and many sacraments will cease to be offered.
This is why much preparation is needed.

For those Catholic who will be hurt and dismayed, please remember that I am here.

Call out to me, your beloved Jesus, and know that you must not be afraid to proclaim the truth of My teachings.

You must not be afraid to turn your back on heresy.

I will guide and protect you on your journey and you will be guided by the power of the Holy Spirit. Your beloved Saviour
Jesus Christ

My messages are for all religions and creeds including those who do not believe.
