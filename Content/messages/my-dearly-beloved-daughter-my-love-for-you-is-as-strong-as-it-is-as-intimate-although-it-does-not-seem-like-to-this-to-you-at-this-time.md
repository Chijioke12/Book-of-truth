You need to spend more time in My Company for only by doing this will you find peace in this mission.

My Graces fill your soul now so that you can communicate to the world My messages in the fastest time possible. How weary I am and alone in My Heart right now My daughter.
I fret for those innocent souls who are ignorant of My existence. Good at heart and Christian in the way they treat others, yet, they do not believe in My existence.
I watch each day at the way they live their daily lives with no faith in the existence of God or their future life in the New Paradise. Please help Me to tell them I love them.
Spread My Word and I will ignite a sense of recognition in their souls.

It does not matter if they reject you, My daughter, or My beloved followers; all that is needed is to let them read My messages. I will send the Holy Spirit so that a spark, albeit a tiny one, will ignite a flame of My Love in their souls.
This is My last mission on earth where Holy Messages from the Blessed Trinity are being given to the world.

The Holy Spirit is present in these Words of Divine origin. They are your food to nourish your souls in order to help you prepare for battle.
Listen to the Holy Word of God. Take it, share it and unite all of God's children ready for battle.

Bring all of your brothers and sisters, especially those who struggle to believe in God, towards My Great Mercy. My Heart heaves with love for them. They, each of them, are God's children.
I need their souls so that I can take care of their future so they will have eternal life and happiness.

I can't bear to think of what will happen to them if I can't save them.

My daughter, while My Divine Mercy will save much of humanity, I need you and My followers, My sacred servants and ordinary people to spread the net and find all those poor, unhappy and confused people in need of God's Love.
Spread the net of My Love, like the fisherman, wide and far and in places where God is completely rejected, despised and hated especially.
Then go and find God's precious young children who do not know anything about Christianity, yet they live in so called Christian countries.
Go as far as Russia, China and countries where God is not revered and go and capture souls.

Feed them with My messages. It does not matter how you communicate but do it in a way where it does not seem as if you are preaching.
Entice them through what may interest them. Use every kind of modern communications to do this. I need them quickly. I am relying on the spreading of My Word by all of My followers.
I will guide you.

You will know in your hearts what to do. Ask me to help you with this special Crusade Prayer to make you strong.

Crusade Prayer (72) The Disciple's Prayer

Dear Jesus I am ready to spread your Holy Word.

Give me the courage, the strength and the knowledge to impart

the Truth so that as many souls can be brought to You.

Take me into your Sacred Heart and cover me with your Precious Blood

so that I am filled with the graces to spread conversion for the salvation of all of God's children in every part of the world no matter what their creed is.
I trust in you always.

Your beloved disciple. Amen
