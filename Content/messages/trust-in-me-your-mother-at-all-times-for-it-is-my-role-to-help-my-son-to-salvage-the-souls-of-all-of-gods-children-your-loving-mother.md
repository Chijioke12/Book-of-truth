Crusade of Prayer (69) Prayer to accept the Divine Will of My Father.
Thursday, July 26th, 2012 @ 23:55

"God the Almighty Father, I accept Your Divine Will. Help Your children to accept it.
Stop Satan from denying Your children's right to their Father's inheritance. Never let us give up the fight for our inheritance in Paradise.
Hear our pleas to banish Satan and his fallen angels.

I ask You, dear Father, to cleanse the earth with Your Mercy and to cover us with Your Holy Spirit. Lead us to form Your most holy army, laden with the power to banish the beast, forever. Amen." Go in peace.
Your Jesus

Crusade of Prayer (70) Prayer for Clergy: to remain firm and true to the Holy Word of God
Monday, July 30th, 2012 @ 01:00

"O dear Jesus, help Your sacred servants to recognize the schism within Your Church, as it unfolds. Help Your sacred servants to remain firm and true to Your Holy Word.
Never let worldly ambitions cloud their pure love for You.

Give them the Graces to remain pure and humble before You and to honour Your Most Holy Presence in the Eucharist.

Help and guide all those sacred servants who may be lukewarm in their love for You and re-kindle the Fire of the Holy Spirit in their souls.
Help them to recognize temptation, placed before them to distract them. Open their eyes, so they can see the Truth at all times.
Bless them, dear Jesus, at this time and cover them with Your Precious Blood to keep them safe from harm.

Give them the strength to resist the seduction of Satan, should they be distracted by the allure of denying the existence of sin. Amen."
My sacred servants are the backbone of My Church.

They are the first in line to face a terrible onslaught of attack from Satan at this time.

Help Me to steer them on the path to salvaging the remnants of My Church as it heads into the schism which will be created by the False Prophet shortly.
Gather together and pray for the unification of My sacred servants who are needed to keep My Church strong in the days which lie ahead.
Your Jesus

Tuesday, July 31st, 2012 @ 20:00

"O Jesus, save God's children from the antichrist. Protect us from the plans to control the earth. Lord, save us from the persecution.
Protect dark souls from the antichrist, so that they can be redeemed in Your Eyes.

Help us in our weakness. Strengthen us in spirit to rise and lead each other, as we march in Your army to the Gates of Paradise.
I need You, dear Jesus.
I love You, dear Jesus.
I Glorify Your Presence on earth. I shun the darkness.
I adore You and I surrender myself in body and spirit so, that You can reveal to me the Truth of Your Presence so, that I will always trust in Your Mercy at all times. Amen."
