Those of you with a humble heart and a purity of soul, I call upon you to pray for the souls of those who will die during The Warning.
How they need your prayers. How I need your suffering. Both gifts, given to Me by you, will help save those who cannot be saved by their own free will.
As My Flame of Mercy will be poured over the whole earth, many will rejoice, but it will be a painful time for sinners who will be unable to ask Me for forgiveness, because of pride.
Their purification will be painful and it will take much suffering on their part in order to be redeemed in My Eyes.

How the wicked hearts of man will be torn inside out, and with terror in their souls, many will fall before Me in agony. Let them know that, although they will undergo much anguish, billions will become pure of heart and soul. Then they will be fully prepared for the great day of My Coming.
My daughter, the trials of My followers will increase and intensify before The Warning.

When you offer Me such suffering I will save the souls of millions. Please do not begrudge Me these torments for great miracles will be given despite those ungrateful men who have no shame in their hearts for the wickedness they are guilty of.
Not one man will be spared the sight of the state of their souls as they appear in My Eyes.

When they see the sorry state of their souls they will be deeply ashamed. Those who are genuinely sorry for their offenses against God will be forgiven. They will be required to undergo a cleansing, which they must accept with humility.
Many, many, souls will accept My Hand of Mercy, but for the souls who have committed mortal sin, they will be so hardened that they will shun My Mercy. This Crusade Prayer must be recited for souls for after the Warning.
Crusade Prayer (88) for souls after The Warning

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, show Mercy to all of us poor sinners.

Enlighten those hearts of stone, so desperate in their quest for guidance. Forgive them their iniquities.
Help them, through Your Love and Mercy, to find it in their hearts to grasp Your great Gift of Redemption. I implore You to forgive all souls who reject the Truth of God.
Cover them with Your Light, Dear Jesus so that it will blind them to the wickedness and snares of the devil who will try to cut them off from You for eternity.
I beg You to give all God's children the strength to be thankful for Your Great Mercy.

I ask that You open the door to Your Kingdom to all lost souls who wander the earth in a state of helplessness and hopelessness. Amen.
Go, My disciples, and adhere to My instructions to prepare your souls for My Divine Mercy. Your Jesus
