My child there is a stillness, like the calm before the storm, as the Catholic Church will soon be plunged into crisis. I call on all of my children everywhere to pray for Pope Benedict XVI who is in danger of being exiled from Rome. He, the most Holy Vicar of the Catholic Church, is hated in many quarters within the Vatican.

Pray, pray, pray for all of God's holy servants in the Catholic Church who will be persecuted because of the great divide within the Church which will come about soon.
The great schism will be witnessed by the whole world but it will not be seen to be the case immediately.

The false pope is waiting to reveal himself to the world.

Children do not be deceived because he will not be from God.

The keys of Rome have been returned to my Father, God the Most High who will rule from the Heavens. Great responsibility will be placed on all those holy priests, bishops and cardinals who love my Son dearly. They will need much courage and divine fortitude to lead souls towards the New Paradise.
Every effort by these holy disciples to prepare souls for the Second Coming of my dearly beloved Son will be opposed by the other dark side.
I urge all of my children to pray for the strength needed as the antichrist and his partner the false prophet will rise to prominence.

You must ask me, the Mother of Salvation for prayers to ensure that the Catholic Church will be saved and that the true word of my Son is salvaged.
The truth of my Son's promise to return in great glory will be tampered with.

You, my dear children, will be given a series of untruths which you will be expected to honour and accept in the holy name of my Son.
My crusade prayer (38) must be said for the next month every single day to ensure that God's holy priests do not fall for the wicked deceit which is being planned by the False Prophet and his followers.
O Blessed Mother of Salvation Please pray for the Catholic Church
In these difficult times and for our beloved Pope Benedict XVI to ease his suffering

We ask you Mother of Salvation

To cover God's sacred servants with Your holy mantle
So that they are given the graces to be strong, loyal and brave During the trials they face

Pray too that they will look after their flock

In accordance with the true teachings of the Catholic Church

O Holy Mother of God give us, your remnant Church on earth, The gift of leadership so that we can help lead souls
Towards the Kingdom of your Son
