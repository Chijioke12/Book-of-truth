My dearly beloved daughter the time is close for the final mysteries of God the Most High to be revealed to the whole world. Your voice, My daughter, will finally complete God's plan on earth to reveal the Truth of My Second Coming.
As you reveal the secrets within the seven seals which I, Jesus the Lamb of God now open, you will infuriate many.

The wicked lies perpetrated by those who pretend to be servants of My Church will be exposed by the sound of your voice.

Every vile act committed by Satan's followers who dare to declare themselves followers of Mine will be exposed. Every lie, laid bare, for all to see.
The new false Church, created by the antichrist, will be shown for what it is.

Every attempt made to deceive God's children will be turned upside down as the battle to save humanity intensifies.

The blasphemies uttered by those who do not speak in My Holy Name will be witnessed by all, although many will not accept the Truth of God as it is being given to the world now.
The words, hidden for so long, and shut up until the end are now pouring from My lips.

No man will be excluded from the Truth. All will be shown the True Word as I prepare, once again, to save mankind from eternal damnation.
The prophecies given to John, and not revealed up to now, are being presented at this time to wake up the world.

The Gospels will once again, after so long, be spread throughout the world. The blind will see again.
The dumb will speak with the truth, like honey, pouring from their lips.

The deaf will listen and the Truth will bring them the comfort missing for so long from their lives.

The apostasy will crack open and raw souls, starving for the Truth, will finally accept it with open arms. The power of God will now manifest in every corner.
Be assured that the spawn of Satan and his followers will do everything they can to block the Book of Truth from being given to the world through the love of God.
They will be powerless against it, although it will not seem like that.

The Heavens await now for the time to bring together the whole of humanity for My Glorious Return. Never forsake Me. Welcome Me as I prepare you for My Glorious Second Coming.
Bring your family with you and come into My arms as I prepare to wrap you into the protection of My special graces from Heaven.

I call out to all of you to recognise the last calling, through My 7th Messenger, given the authority to reveal the seven trumpets, the contents of the seventh seal, as the choir of angels prepare for the prophecies to unfold.

Your Jesus

Love is a sign from God. No matter what religion or creed you follow love can only come from God

My dearly beloved daughter I wish to discuss the importance of love and how, without love, the world could not survive.

God is love. Love comes from God.

Where you find love you instantly feel the presence of God.

Nearly everyone in the world feels love at some stage. Love frees the soul and its purity gives you a glimpse as to the depth of the love that God has for every single one of His children.
Love defeats death.

Love defeats evil.

Love is ever lasting. It can never die for it comes from God and will last for eternity.

When love is attacked in this life by the evil one, who acts through souls, it suffers, withers and can be replaced by indifference or, at times, hatred.
It is only through love, especially for each other, that peace in the world can evolve. Without love people would die and become barren.
When you love a child you are feeling the same kind of love that My Father holds in His Heart for each child born in the world through His creation.
Imagine a parent's anguish when a child goes missing.

The grief, the worry and the anxiety are identical that felt by My Father when His children wander and become lost to the Truth of His existence.
Then imagine the horror which a parent has to endure if their child cannot be found.

What if they become lost forever? This is the heartbreak My Father endures when He loses His children. Nothing consoles Him until He can find them again or when they turn and come running home to Him again. The whole of creation was founded through the love of My Father.
His Love floods the Heavens and the earth and is intensely powerful.

All was created by His Divine Love and His generousity of heart so that he could share all the wonders of creation with His children.
His love for His children will never die.

His betrayal by Lucifer, to whom He gave everything, has meant that His love for humanity has not been reciprocated by much of mankind.
But as an ever loving Father, His love is so powerful that nothing can ever kill His love for His children. His love means that every person has been given a second chance.
The Warning, a great Gift sanctioned by My Father, is a special calling from Heaven.

This calling, a great supernatural miracle, will give each of you the chance of being saved; of being called and of being given the key to open the door to the New Paradise on earth.
For those of you who accept the Key to Paradise you will, in effect, defeat the beast. The world will be finally rid of evil, sin, suffering and every pain.
Peace will reign.

Love for My Father will flourish finally and you will all live according to His Divine Will.

Love is a sign from God. No matter what religion or creed you follow love can only come from God.

It is the light present in every soul, even those who are hardened sinners, for God does not extinguish his light ever.

Grasp it. Embrace it. Cling on to love for it will lead you to Him. Love will save you from the dark.
Your Jesus

The pact with Satan is almost over and two events must soon take place.
