Those prayers, recited diligently by My precious and much loved followers are so powerful, because they are said from the heart.

I grant great Graces upon all My disciples to enable them to forge ahead knock down any obstacles, which they may confront in their drive to salvage souls through this Mission.
My dearly beloved disciples know that the angels in Heaven guide you, protect you and lead you towards My goal, the goal to convert the world.
Many of you who are new to My Messages will wonder if these Words are simply to guide or to convert people.

They are being given to do both but, more importantly, to save all so that everyone can live in the New Era of Peace in the world. For this is My promise. This is the great Gift.
The Gift from My Eternal Father is to give each child of His the most perfect life in the most perfect world in the way it was meant to be from the beginning.
Nothing can, nor will, prevent this New Paradise on earth from emerging.

It will rise from the grey drab world you live in, which has been sullied by a rottenness created by Satan. So rotten is the infestation that not many people know the Truth.
They do not know the difference between good or evil. Many confuse the two.

When people accept evil as part of their lives and justify its presence they deny the Word of God. Yet it is only by accepting the Truth of the Word of God that the Covenant, the final Covenant, can be fulfilled.
The plan of the final salvation of humanity is succeeding but there is still a while to go before I can salvage all those souls who are still beyond My reach.
Only the Truth will open their eyes.

Only the Truth, if accepted by them, will set them free so that they can enter the gates of the New Paradise. Your Jesus
