My daughter, it is important that those who follow the Teachings of the Roman Catholic Church accept the millennium, as promised to all of My children.
The Words contained in My Holy Book, the Holy Bible, do not lie.

My Promise is contained in the Acts of the Apostles.

John the Evangelist was also told about the Glorious Return of My beloved Son, when He will reign in the new Era of Peace for 1,000 years.
Why do those who profess to understand My Holy Word refuse to accept part of it, but not the other? To those sacred servants of mine, I say to you now to open the Book of Truth.
You have a duty to proclaim the Truth.

You must not listen to those, within your ranks, who twist the Truth in relation to the New Era of Peace on Earth.

What motivates your brothers, within My Roman Catholic Church, who deny the Truth? You have confused My children.
Because of their loyalty to the One True Church, The Roman Catholic Church, you are denying them the chance to prepare their souls for My Son's Reign in the New Paradise on Earth.
Your duty is to inform My children of the Truth.

To My children, you must never deny the Truth contained in the Holy Bible, which contains the True Word. You, My children, must accept the Promise made by My Son, after His Glorious Resurrection from the dead. He said that He would come again.
This time, for the Second Coming of My Beloved Son on Earth, is drawing close.

If you believe in the Promises made by My Son, then you will know that He means what He said.

When He comes again, He comes to Rule and take up His Rightful Throne in the New Paradise I have created for you all on Earth.
Never doubt the Words from the Divine Lips of My Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.

Know that I, your Beloved Father, want you all to join as one family with My Son in Paradise. Accept the Truth. Do not twist it or adjust it to suit your flawed interpretation of the Truth.
I Am the Truth.

You cannot change Me or Who I Am. The Truth will set you free.
Your beloved Father God the Most High

There will be no death. No illness. No sin in the New Paradise

My dearly beloved daughter you must never forget that, despite My stern warnings to humanity, I hold a very special love in my heart for all of My children.
It is necessary to purify the earth now for were I to return now it would not be fit for Me to walk upon it. When mankind has been purified only those with love for Me and My Eternal Father will remain.
My chosen generation will be with Me for eternity. This Paradise will offer 1,000 years of peace, love and harmony.

After this period the second resurrection of the dead will take place.

Only then can eternal life be offered to all souls with the light of God shining through them. Why do you hesitate My daughter don't you know that these prophesies have been foretold?
Let no man misunderstand. You, children of this generation, will be given the gift of living in the Paradise, even more beautiful than that prepared for Adam and Eve.
Age will be non-existent as man will live in peace with families of generations.

So much love and enjoyment will be an everyday occurrence. Finally you will be accorded true lasting peace in your souls.

Why would this not be possible? This is the earth that was planned by My Father whose Divine Will, will at last finally be realised on earth as it is in Heaven.
Rejoice all of you. The New Paradise is to be welcomed with excitement and anticipation. There will be no death. No illness. No sin. You will be given the gift of eternal happiness.
Pray for those who, through sin and disobedience, will forfeit any claim to their rightful inheritance which was planned by My Eternal Father since the beginning of time.
Your Beloved Jesus

Never reject the prophets of the Lord

My daughter it is imperative that you remain silent as the persecution begins.

The Holy Word of My Eternal Father will be rejected by those very sacred servants who claim to proclaim the truth of His Most Holy Word.
The Catholic Church is the one true Church.

All Churches will unite to become one Holy and Apostolic Church at My Second Coming.

Until that happens every word from My Father, given to a spiritually dry world, will be either ignored, challenged or fiercely opposed.

Those who will fiercely oppose My messages given to you, the 7th messenger for the end times, will be divided into two camps.
Those who follow Satan through new age fortune telling and witchcraft.

The others will be those who are spiritually blind but who believe they are divinely inspired with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.

Both will reject the word of God given to you through the Holy Trinity and My beloved Mother.

Even good priests, forbidden to publicly endorse these messages, will feel it is justified to vilify My Holy Word for all the world to hear.
With little true humility in their hearts they will set out to undermine this call from Heaven which is being given to help humanity. These priests, clergy and other self-appointed apostles who claim to know Me will try to encourage souls to reject My word.
They have no shame for they will arrogantly pull My Book of Truth apart as it is being revealed to all of mankind.

Then, they will shred the contents with venom in their hearts.

They do not want to hear the truth for it will upset and rattle the cocoon of false security within which they wrap themselves. Oh how they offend Me.
How much damage they will cause and, yet, they do not realise this.

Pray that these souls, blind to the truth through the influence of the deceiver will open their hearts and accept the Word of God as it is presented to them today.
They have no right to publicly dismiss these messages without discerning them with a clean soul which must be humble in all things.
While God allows the sufferings experienced by his visionaries on earth to ensure that souls are saved He will not tolerate the abuse of his anointed prophets.
You, My daughter are a prophet. You accept suffering as a gift to me.
But this is not about you for you are nothing without Me and you know and accept this. God My Father speaks to the world through His prophets.
It is His word you reject when you publicly slander His prophets.

For this is a sin in His eyes.

Never reject the prophets of the Lord.

Never hurt or harm His prophets in any way.

Remain silent at all times if in doubt and pray for them.

Attack the true prophet and fire will pour forth upon you from the Heavens in punishment by the Hand of My Father.

No man will stop the Word of the Lord from being given to His children.

This is the promise made by My Father since the beginning. Hear His voice.
Accept that you are in the end times.

Pray that these messages will be heard so that all of God's children will have eternal life. Your Teacher
Redeemer of all Mankind Jesus Christ
