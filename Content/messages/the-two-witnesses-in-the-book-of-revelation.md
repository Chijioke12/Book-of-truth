You, My followers, are one of the Two Witnesses referred to in the Book of Revelation and who will be protected from the Heavens.
My Word, given to you My Remnant Church, may be cast aside as a corpse but My Word will never die.

The Jews will be the second of the Two Witnesses.

The two lamps are My Christian Churches, the traditional true Church and those followers of Mine who will be cast aside by the False Prophet.
The two Olive Trees are the Old Jerusalem Israel and the New Israel.

They, the Jews, will know that I am the Messiah at last and their preaching of the truth will also be cast aside and thrown out by the False Prophet and the Anti-Christ to rot like a corpse. Again, this chosen race will not die.
Both will feel defeated but this will not be the case for you will form, along with all other religions, the one true Church - the New Jerusalem which will rise from the Ashes.

You will survive the terrible evil monarchy which will arise under the dual leadership of the False Prophet and the Anti-Christ, both of whom will be cast into the lake of fire that is Hell.
This persecution will not last long and you will be given great strength and protection.

Help will be given to you and many leaders will arise amongst you to guide you through this period.

Many of you will become saints in My New Paradise and, having helped build My Remnant Church on earth, will reign with me in the New Heaven and Earth which will emerge at My Second Coming.
Those of you who are not with Me will be given a very short time to choose. You will either be for the False Prophet and against me or you will be for Me.
Choose the first and your soul will be stolen by the deceiver. Harsh as this sounds, it is the truth. Proof of My Presence will be given to all of God's children during The Warning.
Pray that you will accept the truth then that it is I, your beloved Jesus, who calls to you from Heaven to open your eyes so that you can see and so that you will listen so that you can hear before it is too late.
