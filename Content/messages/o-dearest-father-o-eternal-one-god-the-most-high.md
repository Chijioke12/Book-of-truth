Make me worthy of Your Love.

Please forgive me for hurting others and for any wrong-doing, which has caused suffering to any of your children.
Open my heart so that I can welcome you into my soul, and cleanse me of any hatred I may feel against another person.

Help me to forgive my enemies and to sow the seeds of Your Love everywhere I go and amongst those whom I meet every day.

Give me, Dear Father, the Gifts of Perseverance and Trust, so that I can uphold Your Holy Word and thus keep alive, in a darkened world, the flame of Your Great Love and Mercy.
Amen.

Crusade Prayer (169) For the salvation of those who reject Christ
Tuesday, October 7th, 2014 @ 19:07

Dearest Jesus, by Your Compassion and Mercy,

I beg you for the salvation of those who have rejected You; Who deny Your Existence;
Who deliberately oppose Your Holy Word and whose bitter hearts have poisoned their souls against the Light and the Truth of Your Divinity.
Have Mercy on all sinners.

Forgive those who blaspheme against the Holy Trinity and

Help me, in my own way, and through my personal sacrifices, to embrace within Your Loving Arms, those sinners who need Your Mercy the most.
I give You my promise, that through my thoughts, my actions and the spoken word, to serve You as best I can in Your Mission of Salvation.
Amen.
