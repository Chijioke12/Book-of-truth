Crusade Prayer (72) The Disciple's Prayer
Tuesday, August 7th, 2012 @ 18:34

"Dear Jesus, I am ready to spread Your Holy Word.

Give me the courage, the strength and the knowledge, to impart the Truth, so that as many souls as possible can be brought to You.
Take me into Your Sacred Heart and cover me with Your Precious Blood, so that I am filled with the Graces to spread conversion for the Salvation of all of God's children, in every part of the world no matter what their Creed is.
I trust in You always. Your beloved disciple. Amen."
