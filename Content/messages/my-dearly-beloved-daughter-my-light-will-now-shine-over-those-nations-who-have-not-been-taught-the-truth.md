Where there is no mention of God, My Divine Presence, will now fill every corner of those nations who do not honour Me, although they are aware of Who I Am. The veil of darkness will be lifted and, at last, these starved souls will drink My Holy Spirit and devour My Holy Word. After all this time, they, through the spread of My Prayer Groups, will be given the Truth.
I refer to those nations where your churches lie empty, where the Sacraments are rarely made available, and where daily Masses are no longer celebrated. It is up to you, My beloved disciples, to spread My Holy Word, so that dark souls, and those who know nothing about Me, are enlightened and encouraged, gently, to come to Me.
I bless you, and by the Power of My deep Love for each and every one of you, I will increase your numbers, greatly. My Prayer Groups will be set up in every country, and with the Gift of the Holy Spirit, you will prophecy in My Holy Name all over the world.
Remind all of My Teachings. Remind souls to read the Holy Bible, one of the greatest Gifts given to you by My Father. Recite My Prayers; read My Glorious Messages and pray that you can reach even the most hardened of hearts.
I will grant you many Gifts and I will instruct you for every step you take on the Path of Truth.

Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: It is by the power of prayer that my Son's Mercy can be spread throughout the world
Wednesday, January 23rd, 2013 @ 16:05

My children, you must strive to devote at least fifteen minutes a day in the recital of the Crusade Prayers, as this is very important.
You must find the time to say these prayers, as they are already mitigating many tragedies in the world, which are caused by those wicked people who carry out acts of evil.
You must never forget the power of prayer, or the fact that, through my intercession, I can help you in your struggle with your Faith.
Many of you are busy with other matters in your lives, but you must make every effort to pay homage to my Son. Prayer can be difficult for many.
It can be difficult to pray in private, and for those who cannot see the most perfect and beautiful Face of my Son, Jesus Christ, they are easily distracted.
Here is a little Crusade Prayer (95) To help find time for prayer.

O Mother of Salvation, come to my aid, as I struggle to find the time for prayer.

Help me to give, to your beloved Son, Jesus Christ, the time He deserves to show Him how much I love Him.

I ask that you, my Blessed Mother of Salvation, seek for me the Graces I need and ask your dear Son for every grace and favour, so that He can envelop me into the Bosom of His Sacred Heart.
Amen.

Children, to follow the Path of Truth, all you need do is give the time, which is needed, to prayer. It is by the power of prayer that my Son's Mercy can be spread throughout the world. It will be by your recital of the Crusade Prayers that the Covenant can be fulfilled by my Son to salvage the world.
Your Beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

I urge My followers to remind people of the importance of reading the Holy Bible
Wednesday, January 23rd, 2013 @ 16:40

My dearly beloved daughter, I Am joyful and pleased because of the love, which My disciples hold in their hearts for Me.

Heaven rejoices at the speed in which My Divine Messages and Prayers are spreading throughout the world. This is the time, foretold, so very long ago, when My Holy Gospel will be preached throughout the whole world.
I urge My followers to remind people of the importance of reading the Holy Bible, the Word set out, according to the Will of My Father.
Today, My Word is spoken, yet again, to instil in the minds of people, today, the importance of My Teachings. Failure to accept the Word of God results in the death of the soul.
Every man on earth was born with free will. For every man, given life by My Father, the Sacrament of Baptism was made available, but not every child of God was given access to this important Gift, which cleanses the soul and rids it of demons.
Every man was entitled to the Truth of My Teachings, yet not every man was given the Truth. In its place, false religions were fed into the souls of innocents. This led to hatred for one another, as the lies, created and spread by such false religions, infested the hearts of man.
The Truth is that My Holy Word is the food of the soul. Without it the soul withers. When it is empty of the peace, which My Love brings to it, it then seeks solace in the arms of worldly things, which drain it of every comfort, eventually.
Now that My Holy Word is being ignited in the hearts of jaded men, My Love will spread when the Truth is given to humanity. This Love will draw hungry souls, and so My Plan of Salvation will continue. I will exhaust every avenue, using the hearts of humble souls - who truly love Me - in order to save the whole of the human race. It does not matter what god they idolise because, very soon, the Truth will be revealed to them. Then, they will want for nothing, only My Glorious Presence.
Your Jesus

I will mitigate much of the suffering foretold, through the power of My Crusade Prayer Groups
Friday, January 25th, 2013 @ 20:00

My dearly beloved daughter, I desire to instruct My Crusade Prayer Groups to be vigilant when setting up in their nations. They must keep Holy Water close by, have a Crucifix of Me present and recite this special Crusade Prayer to Bless and Protect your Crusade Prayer Group.
Crusade Prayer (96) to Bless and Protect our Crusade Prayer Group

O my dearest Jesus, please bless and protect us, Your Crusade Prayer Group, so that we become immune to the wicked assaults of the devil, and to any evil spirits, which may torment us in this Sacred Mission to save souls.
May we remain loyal and strong, as we persevere to keep Your Holy Name before the world and never waive in our struggle to spread the Truth of Your Holy Word.
Amen.

Please recite this prayer before and after every prayer meeting.

I must also instruct you, My beloved disciples, to ensure that prayer forms the basis for every prayer meeting. I do not wish you to contemplate negativity or create fear amongst yourselves, because all I bring is Love and Mercy.
My Messages are full of hope and I will mitigate much of the suffering foretold, through the power of My Crusade Prayer Groups. The purpose of this Mission is to save souls. It has never been about anything else. My Messages are given to enlighten you, to alert you to the dangers, which affect your faith, and to prepare you for My New Paradise.
Go now, in Peace. I will cover each Crusade Prayer Group with My Abundance of Graces, including the Gift of Discernment.
Your Jesus

They will sob with relief when they realise that they have a future where death does not exist
Friday, January 25th, 2013 @ 23:20

My dearly beloved daughter, My Power is surging through the Power of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of man at this time. Even cold and distant souls will be converted through the Gifts I shower over humanity because of your generous response to My Call from Heaven.
Not one nation will fail to accept the Power of the Holy Spirit; not one stone will be left unturned; not one priest unaware of My Messages; not one beloved disciple of Mine left untouched, by the news that I bring. Even those who reject Me will come back a second time to hear My Word because My Spirit touches their hearts.
Rejoice, because it is only two years since this Mission began and My Word is read in over two hundred countries and in almost forty languages. I will continue to spread My Messages, in every tongue; amongst the rich and the poor; amongst atheists and sacred servants of Mine.
I do not differentiate between the person who does not believe in God and those who devote their lives to Me, their Jesus. Each soul is every much as important to Me as those who hurt Me; those who betray Me; who make Me weep; those who assault Me; crucify Me and hate Me - I Love them all. Therefore, I Am patient. I know that when the Truth sinks in, they will come to Me. Then they will sob, with relief, when they realise that they have a future where death does not exist.
This is My Promise and when you are troubled, scourged, abused and made to look like fools, this is all you need focus on. This New Paradise is for all of you. When you fight to save souls, keep this promise in your hearts.
