Crusade of Prayer (19) Prayer for young people
Friday, January 13th, 2012 @ 08:00

Virgin Mary: Prayer for young people who don't know what they are doing

My child I am sorrowful today because I suffer much as I think of those poor souls who will die during The Warning. You must ask for urgent prayer for these souls who anger My Father. Their behaviour is an abomination in His eyes. Please pray, pray, pray for these children of the dark many of whom do not know what they are doing.
Their wickedness causes My Son to weep and his wounds to fester. It is important that as many souls as possible are enveloped into the arms of My Son at His Divine Mercy. Please ask for this Crusade of Prayer to be said to me, the Mother of Salvation, to save these poor children.
"Mother of Salvation, I ask you to pray for the Mercy of young souls who are in terrible darkness so, that they recognise your beloved Son when He comes to Redeem the whole of mankind.
Let not one soul fall by the wayside. Let not one soul reject His Great Mercy.

I pray, Mother, that all are saved and ask you to cover these souls with your Holy Mantle to provide them the protection they need from the deceiver. Amen."
My child all souls are important to My Son. But it is the young souls in mortal sin that hurt Him the most.

Pray that the light of Mercy shines through the darkness of their minds and souls. Pray that they will reject their terrible lives of depravity and emptiness that they lead. Pray that they will reach up and beg for mercy otherwise they will never receive the graces they need to enter the New Paradise.
What a loss these young people will be to the rest of you who will accept the gift of the Warning and enter the New Era of Paradise on earth. It will break My Son's heart if they cannot be saved.
Your beloved Mother Mary Queen of Heaven Mother of Salvation

I beg You, Almighty Father, to stop him from inflicting terror on Your children.

I beg You to stop him from contaminating Your Creation and ask You to have Mercy on those poor souls who will be powerless against him.
Hear my prayer, dear Father, and save all Your children from this terrible evil. Amen."

We beg You, O Lord, to save those who follow the evil one and that their hearts will be opened to the Truth of their Eternal Life. Amen."
Rejoice children for this great gift.

But you have still much work to do to help souls as many of your brothers and sister will remain stubbornly opposed to the truth of My Holy word.
Your Beloved Jesus Saviour of all Mankind

Crusade of Prayer (22) Catholic Priests to uphold the teachings of the church
Saturday, January 28th, 2012 @ 22:23

I need you to prepare My flock in order to welcome Me during My long awaited Second Coming on earth.

No one will, or can, destroy My Church. Out of the ashes it will rise to proclaim My Glory as I come back to salvage My Kingdom on earth.

You must never desert Me, your beloved Saviour, ever.

For without Me there is no light. Without light there is no future.

My daughter I give the world this Crusade of Prayer (22) for the Catholic Clergy to recite

"O my beloved Jesus, keep me strong and the flame of my love for You alight, every moment of my day. Never allow this flame of love for You to flicker or die.
Never allow me to weaken in the presence of temptation.

Give me the graces needed to honour my vocation, my devotion, my loyalty and, to uphold the Teachings of the Orthodox Catholic Church.
I offer You my allegiance, at all times. I pledge my commitment to fight in Your army, so that the Catholic Church can rise again in glory to welcome You, dear Jesus, when You come again. Amen."

Crusade of Prayer (25) For Protection of visionaries around the world
Saturday, February 4th, 2012 @ 10:09

I will now give you a Crusade Prayer (25) to ask for protection for all my visionaries and those chosen by God the Father to spread His most holy word on earth in these times.
"O God of the Most High, I plead with You to offer protection to all Your holy messengers in the world. I pray that they are protected from the hatred of others.
I ask that Your Most Holy Word is spread quickly, all over the world. Protect Your messengers from slander, abuse, lies and every kind of danger.
Protect their families and cover them with the Holy Spirit, at all times, so that the Messages they give to the world are heeded with contrite and humble hearts. Amen."
My child, pride is a trait which is most displeasing in the eyes of My Father. It is more painful for Him when the sins of pride invades the souls of devout and holy souls when they refuse to accept the truth of His Holy Word given to the world today through His messengers.
They must ask for the gift of true discernment which will only be granted by the power of the Holy Spirit to humble souls with a pure heart empty of pride and arrogance.
