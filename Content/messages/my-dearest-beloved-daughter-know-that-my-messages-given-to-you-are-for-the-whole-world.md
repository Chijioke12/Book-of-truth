They are being given to all religions and creeds including those who do not believe in the existence of God the Eternal Father, Creator of the whole world.
Children you must know that because you have been given the Truth of The Triune God, the Holy Trinity that is made of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, that you have a responsibility to proclaim My Holy Word to the whole world.
Whether or not you believe that I speak to you through these messages or not you must help those poor souls who need My protection so that they can be saved.
Many question why these messages refer to Satan so many times. My answer is this. Satan and his fallen angels roam the earth looking to infest human beings.
They attack them through the senses mainly to encourage them to commit sins of the flesh. They put thoughts into their minds so that they commit atrocities, which offend My Father.
In the case of souls, already in sin, they can possess the body. When this happens these poor possessed souls create havoc around them.
If they are in positions of power they can inflict terrible injustice among those over whom they rule.

They will introduce laws, which defy the Ten Commandments laid down by God the Father. In other cases they will cause great anguish in people's lives.
Negativity is caused by Satan and his demon angels. This does not come from God.

Only peace and love can come from God.

For all those who want to rid their lives of negative thoughts and feelings all that is required is devotion to Me, their beloved Jesus Christ.
Prayer, simple conversation, is enough. In your own words ask Me to help you.

Said from the heart I will respond immediately and help you to come closer to My Sacred Heart.

Please, children, let Me hold you close and give you the comfort you crave in a world full of unhappiness, injustice, cruelty and hatred.
I am your lifeline. Only I can help you. Please call out to Me in this Crusade Prayer (45) Oh Jesus I know very little about You.
But please help me to open my heart to allow You to come into my soul so that You can heal me, comfort me and fill me with your peace.
Help me to feel joy, conquer all negative thoughts and learn the way to make me understand how to please You, so that I can enter Your New Paradise where I can live a life of love, joy and wonder with You forever and ever. Amen.
I love all of you dear children no matter what creed you are, no matter how much you have sinned, caused hurt or harm to others. Only I can change the way you live.
The only way to free yourself from the difficult life you lead is to call Me so I can help you. Your beloved Jesus

Never take unfair advantage of others even in business, politics or any walk of life.

My dearest daughter I want you to tell all of My followers that their prayers are being heard and that many evil events are being mitigated as a result.
I also wish it to be known that as a result of your suffering My daughter that I have been able to save four million souls. My Mercy has been poured over these children of God, who are still alive in the world today.
Other sacrifices offered by those followers of mine who, through prayer and fasting, are helping Me to save people from a terrible destiny.
Your strength, love, loyalty and perseverance means that Satan's power is being diluted.

It also means that the power of the global One World Group is weakening. You must know that prayer weakens evil in the world.
The more prayer the less power that Satan holds.

Never underestimate even one person's prayer and suffering for it wields great reprieve for those who would, otherwise, face the fires of Hell.
The love you feel children, given to you as a natural gift at birth, is a pure thing.

Rarely does hatred enter your life until you reach the age of reason.

Children under this age are innocent, pure and humble in My Eyes and see things in a simple uncomplicated way. This is the true love you must try to recapture in your lives.
When you look at life in a simple way, honour God, the Father, Creator of all things and obey His Commandments, then you become like a child again.
You become pure, loving, simple of heart and empty of malice. Then you will be given the strength of the Holy Spirit so that your faith will be unshakeable.
You will become like a child but will be given the armour of a warrior, a true and honourable member of God's Army.

In time, you will reign with Me, side by side, in the New Paradise.

Keep your love for others simple. Never offer love on condition it offers you something in return.

Instead offer love with no strings attached. Offer love to others as a gift to God. See everyone you meet in your life, through the eyes of God.
Each person was created by God. Each brought into the world through the love of God.

Even though certain souls are born with a severe cross to bear they are presented into the world by God with love. Love each other, despite the faults of each other, in honour of My Father.
Search out each face and look upon it as if you are seeing this person in the eyes of God.

Only then will you find it easier to refrain from judging others.

Try to find the best and the good in everyone. Show love and kindness to each other. Never take unfair advantage of others even in business, politics or any walk of life.
When you come across evil, present in others, pray hard for their soul and offer a small token sacrifice to Me, your Jesus, in atonement for their sins.
Suffering a little, making small sacrifices for the souls of others and prayer, can mitigate the intensity of future prophesised persecution.
When you do this the Mercy of My Father can be poured out over the world in a deluge of graces.

Pray, pray, pray that your prayers will help prepare mankind, adequately, before The Warning takes place so that few are lost before they are given the chance to see Me present to them My great gift of love, mercy and reconciliation.
Your loving Jesus Saviour of Mankind

Even those who commit terrible sin are loved by God, the Father.

My dearest beloved daughter My children must be told of the intense love that I hold in My Sacred Heart for every child born on this earth.
Even those who commit terrible sin are loved by God, the Father.

Each one of you is a child of God.

Because of this you are abused, tormented and hurt by Satan and his demons.

To those hardened sinners, members of Satan's army, who know that God exists but who chose to idolise the beast, know this.

No matter how much homage you pay Satan, remember, he does not love you. He hates you and will destroy you.
His promises to offer you a paradise, both on earth and beyond, are empty lies.

Very soon you will be given proof of My love for you. There will be no doubt in your heart that I, your beloved Jesus, want to embrace you, forgive you and bring you eternal peace, love, joy and happiness in My New Kingdom, the New Paradise.
Never be afraid to turn your back on the life you lead where you idolise all the perceived gifts of wealth, sex and other material comforts offered to you by Satan whose reign on this earth comes to an end shortly.
Only I, your beloved Jesus, can save you.

My Mercy is so great that I will forgive you anything when you feel remorse. Hurry come to Me now. Do not waste one second for your future happiness is at stake.
I promise you eternal life, peace, love, joy and a beautiful Paradise where you will be loved, cherished and where you will want for nothing.
If you cannot accept My Hand of Mercy now, then when the time comes on the last day, you will be given one more chance to ask Me for Mercy.
When this day comes you will, many of you, realise the mistake you have made.

Yet I will still embrace you like a long lost and much loved child of God no matter how much you have suffered by the hand of evil. All you have to do will be to call out to Me and ask for My Mercy.
If you are involved, at this time, in a web of deceit and evil from which you cannot escape then I ask you to call on me by reciting this
Crusade Prayer (46) Free me from the chains of Satan

O Jesus, I am lost. I am confused and feel like a prisoner caught in a web I cannot escape from. I trust You, Jesus, to come to my aid and free me from the chains of Satan and his demons.
Help me for I am lost.

I need Your Love to give me the strength to believe in You and trust in You, so that I can be saved from this evil and be shown the Light, so I can find peace, love and happiness at last. Amen.
Your beloved Jesus

Billions of souls, not millions, will convert.
