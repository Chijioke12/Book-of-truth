---

My dearly beloved daughter when I endured the agony in the garden the greatest abomination, shown to Me by Satan, was the disloyalty of the Catholic and Apostolic Church in the end times.
They have allowed pride and false truths, dominated by their tolerance of sin, to blind them to the Truth of God.

Their allegiance to worldly pursuits means that many of My sacred servants do not have the compassion or humility in their souls to lead My followers towards the sanctity required to save their souls.
So many have turned against me although they say they love God's children.

By promoting tolerance in the Name of God, they present a false doctrine, which masks the Truth.

Those dissidents in My Church on earth, who claim to be creating a new type of following in the name of the Catholic Church, but who deny My teachings, are being tempted by Satan who wants to destroy My Church.
He, the evil one, has already caused terrible sin to corrupt My Church and now wants to hammer in the final nails when he will crucify My Church and, in turn, cast into Hell those sacred servants of Mine who desecrate the Word of God by facilitating the acceptance of sin among God's children.
Their sin of slapping Me in the Face, by parading obscenities before Me, which they claim are acceptable and tolerated by God, will be severely punished.
They dare, through the sin of pride and deceit, to mislead souls and direct them into a den of darkness, without understanding how they are condemning souls into the lake of fire.
Many of My sacred servants are being misled and don't know it. Yet many such servants, if they are honest with themselves, are confused.
Then there are those who pose as My sacred servants but come from the other side. Slaves to the beast they deliberately present themselves as my anointed priests.
They cause Me such terrible anguish. Not only do they corrupt souls they have knowingly created a pact with Satan who will devour them.
They perform vile acts on My altars, before the Holy Eucharist but few know that they commit such acts. Yet I yearn for their souls.

My Catholic Church has been torn into shreds, yet the soul of My Church will never be taken or consumed by Satan. But the servants of My Church can be seduced and destroyed by the beast.
This is the time for Me to intervene to help them rise above these terrible torments.

I need you, My followers, and those sacred servants among you who understand what is happening amongst you to say this Crusade Prayer (70) Prayer for Clergy to remain firm and true to the Holy Word of God
O dear Jesus, help Your sacred servants to recognise the schism within Your Church as it unfolds.
Help Your sacred servants to remain firm and true to Your Holy Word. Never let worldly ambitions cloud their pure love for You.
Give them the graces to remain pure and humble before You and to Honour Your Most Holy Presence in the Eucharist.
Help and guide all those sacred servants who may be lukewarm

in their love for You and re-kindle the fire of the Holy Spirit in their souls.

Help them to recognise temptation placed before them to distract them. Open their eyes so they can see the Truth at all times.
Bless them Dear Jesus at this time and cover them with Your Precious Blood to keep them safe from harm.
Give them the strength to resist the seduction of Satan, should they be distracted by the allure of denying the existence of sin.
Amen.

My sacred servants are the backbone of My Church.

They are the first in line to face a terrible onslaught of attack from Satan at this time.

Help Me to steer them on the path to salvaging the remnants of My Church as it heads into the schism which will be created by the False Prophet shortly.
Gather together and pray for the unification of My sacred servants who are needed to keep My Church strong in the days which lie ahead.
Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: Failure to proclaim the Truth of my Son's Teachings means that God is being forgotten

My child the persecution you are enduring is because of the publication of the Book of Truth. The evil one is placing obstacles along your path and will stop at nothing to wear you down.
It is important to ignore the constant wicked lies with which you are being presented by those who claim to be knowledgeable about the Word of God.
Their dismissal of these messages is not important. Only the Word of my Son is what you must respond to and nothing else.

You must trust in my Son and remain silent when those blinded by lies who try to engage with you to trip you up. Do not listen. Do not respond. Instead, simply proclaim the Word of God.
My child so many followers of Christ are suffering at this time. Their voices are but whispers in a world which shouts about the glory of earthly wonders.
The true Word of God is no longer declared openly even by servants of God in the Church.

Embarrassed to be seen to openly declare the Truth they wander hopelessly trying to find their way amongst the confusion caused by secularism.
The offense which is caused when God, or my beloved Son, Jesus Christ, are mentioned is widespread. Very few souls are brave enough to stand up and declare themselves soldiers of Christ.
Even holy souls are frightened to do this for fear of causing outrage amongst the heathen. Failure to proclaim the Truth of my Son's Teachings means that God is being forgotten.
How I weep when I see poor little children who are being ignored by their guardians in the development of their souls.

They lack the nourishment of the Holy Spirit because they are not taught how to profess their love for God. Many do not believe in God the Father. This saddens Him.
You, my child, have been given a difficult task. When you declare to the world the contents of these messages from Heaven you are attacked from three sources.
Those who believe in God but who refuse to listen to the Word of God as it is being given to the world now.

Those who profess to be leaders in my Son's Church on earth who refuse to listen because they do not accept prophecy. And then those who do not believe in God at all.
Your voice will continue to fall on deaf ears but you must not let this discourage you.

All you have to do is to obey my Son in all things and leave everything in His Holy Hands.

In time they will listen. When they do many souls will turn to my Son with love and joy in their hearts.

You must never falter or delay in your response to my Son's request to ensure that everyone in the world I given the Word of God at this time.
I ask all of God's children to respond to my call to pay allegiance to my Son's Holy Word now. He loves all of God's children and wishes to prepare every soul for His long awaited Second Coming.
Do not deny Him. Accept His Hand of Mercy before it is too late. Your loving Mother
Queen of the Earth Mother of Salvation

Allow Me to lift you, from all harm, to safety away from the Antichrist.
