Start by making the Sign of the Cross and blessing yourself:

In the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Then recite the Apostle's Creed:
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,	Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ,	His only Son Our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,	born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.	He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;	He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.	I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting. Amen.
Then say 1 Our Father, 3 Hail Marys (for the virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity) and then 1 Glory Be:

Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death. Amen.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
While meditating on the Mysteries, recite:

One Our Father (large beads)

10 Hail Marys (small beads)

1 Glory Be (before the next large bead) to make a complete decade of the rosary.

O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need of Thy Mercy.
Repeat these prayers for all five decades of the Rosary.
Hail Holy Queen (or Salve Regina may be sung)

Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
(Verse) Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.

(Response) That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Rosary Prayer

(Verse) Let us pray,

(Response) O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal salvation. Grant, we beseech Thee, that while meditating on these Mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, that we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through Christ our Lord. Amen.
Saint Michael the Archangel Prayer

Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in the day of battle. Be our safeguard against the wickedness and the snares of the devil. May God rebuke him we humbly pray and do thou O Prince of the Heavenly Host cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl throughout the world seeking the ruin of souls.
4. For the Intentions of the Holy Father

Catholics who say the Rosary in a group, or, individually before the Blessed Sacrament,	may gain a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions, which includes prayer for the intentions of the Holy Father.
For the intentions of the Holy Father.

Our Father, one Hail Mary, and one Glory Be.

Conclude with the Sign of the Cross, blessing yourself.

In the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.  Amen.

About
This website contains a series of Divine Messages given to Maria Divine Mercy the European visionary and seer which she has been receiving since 2010. Although Maria, who wishes to remain anonymous, had virtually no knowledge of the Bible, the messages are littered with numerous biblical references, codes and secrets including
The Maria Divine Mercy prophesies and messages are contained in The Book of Truth, foretold in the Book of Daniel. God the Father, she explains, has given her 'The Seal of the Living God' Crusade Prayer (33) - a prayer of protection against the antichrist also foretold in the Bible in the Book of Revelation
The Catholic Church will be taken over by the enemies of God from within and this will lead to the greatest apostasy of all time
The Second Coming will herald the return of Christ to judge the living and the dead The world will witness the rise of Satanism and new age paganism
140 Crusade Prayers were dictated to Maria Divine Mercy by God the Father, His beloved Son Jesus Christ and the Blessed Mother of God, the Virgin Mary who has asked the world that she be known as the Mother of Salvation through these messages.
Many people have accepted the messages as they are. Many don't. An evaluation of the warning second coming website has been made by many people, and this has led to questions as to whether Maria Divine Mercy is true or false. Maria Divine Mercy's real name is not being made public and she wishes to remain anonymous.
While theologians argue as to whether the Warning Second Coming website is a hoax or not the fact is that hundreds of Crusade Prayer Groups have been set up around the world on the back of this Mission. The messages have been translated into over 28 languages and without any help or assistance from this website.
In less than three and a half years three volumes of the messages which total 2,000 in all (most of which have been published) have been produced in book format in print and in eBook through Apple, Amazon Kindle, Kobo and Overdrive. People are not obliged to buy the books as the messages are free to download on this site. However, people have requested that the Book be published as well as the Crusade Prayer Book and they are available through this website through an independent publisher and re-sellers throughout Great Britain and other parts of the world.

What is the Warning
THE ILLUMINATION OF CONSCIENCE predicted by Our Lady in Garabandal in 1961 will take place soon to save the world.WHY IS THE WARNING TAKING PLACE?
To prove to all that God exists.
To bring everyone back to Jesus and the way of the truth.
To dilute the impact of sin and evil in the world through conversion.
To help save us before the final day of judgement by giving us a chance to ask for forgiveness for the sins we have committed.
To convert non-believers who would have no chance of redemption without this great act of mercy. To strengthen the faith of believers.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE WARNING

Every one over the age of 7 will experience a private mystical encounter with Jesus Christ which will last anything up to 15 minutes
It is a gift from God the Father to convert people back to the truth. It is how the Final Day of Judgement will unfold only this time you will not be condemned. Instead you will be given a chance to ask for forgiveness.
Two comets will collide in the sky.
People will believe it to be catastrophic worse than an earthquake But it is not - it is a sign that Jesus has come. The sky will turn red it will look like a fire & then you will see a large cross in the sky to prepare you first.
Atheists will say it was a global illusion. Scientists will look for a logical explanation but there won't be one. It will be spectacular and will not hurt us because it comes as an act of Love and Mercy from Jesus.
Our sins will be shown to us and this will make us feel tremendous sorrow and shame when they are revealed to us. Others will be so sickened and shocked by the way in which their sins will be revealed that they will drop dead before they have a chance to ask for forgiveness.
Everyone will see the state of their soul before God - the good they have done in their lives, the grief they have inflicted on others and all that which they failed to do.
Many people will fall down and cry tears of relief. Tears of joy and happiness. Tears of wonder and love. For, at last, it will be possible to live a new life thereafter when we know the full truth.
Jesus is now asking everyone to pray for those souls who will die of shock who may be in mortal sin. Everyone needs to prepare now. Jesus asks that all ask for the forgiveness of their sins in advance of The Warning.

What is the second coming
MUCH CONFUSION EXISTS in the world regarding this event.
Many people believe that My Second Coming indicates that the END OF THE WORLD has come.
THAT IS NOT THE CASE for, instead, it will mean the END TIMES when Satan and his followers who create untold misery in the world will be BANISHED FROM EARTH FOR 1,000 YEARS. LINK TO MESSAGE
