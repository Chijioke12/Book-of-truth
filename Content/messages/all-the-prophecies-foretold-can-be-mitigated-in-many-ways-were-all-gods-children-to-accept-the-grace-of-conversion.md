My child let all God's children know that the more opposition that there is to the Holy Word of my Son, at this time, the more will be the graces poured out upon the disciples of my Beloved Son.

Conversion can weaken the impact of the antichrist. Your daily prayers, including the recital of the Crusade Prayers will help bring this about.
To those who oppose my Son's Mission on earth I ask that you pray for their souls.

This battle for souls is intense and you must rise above the torment and the scourging to ask me to pray for poor misguided souls who believe that they speak in the Name of my Son but who are, instead, being deceived by the evil one.
My Son will never give up His quest for souls especially those who reject Him, mock His Holy Word and whose souls are blackened by sin.
You must stay strong, children, all of you and remain firm in your resolution to do the Holy Will of my Son. This will not be easy but to gain entry to the New Paradise is not easy.
It requires much patience, much prayer, much love for one another and the ability to forgive all those who cause you grief and who desecrate the Word of my Son.
Thank you for responding to my call. Mother of Salvation

Important Message God the Father: I will grant immunity from the Gates of Hell to those souls for whom you pray.
Thursday, August 23rd, 2012 @ 15:15

My dearest daughter it has been seldom that the Holy Trinity has communicated to mankind in this way and the first time that I, your Father, has sanctioned a Mission of this kind.
My children, many of whom do not realise the significance of this Divine Intervention, will understand soon why it is necessary.

If the Second Coming of My Beloved Son were to occur, without warning, My precious children would never enter the gates of My New Paradise.
They would never have been able to prepare their souls and would not be fit to be admitted to the New Era of Peace.

This is a communication which the world will find difficult to respond to.

So dark is the cloud which covers the hearts of man that few souls will be able to see the Light of My Divine Promise. The forces of evil, ever present in the world, prevent My children from reaching out to Me.
My determination to bring My family close and to unite them to My Bosom is fierce.

Let no man fail to understand that I will facilitate the rapid conversion of humanity, whatever the cost.

Allowing for the free will of all of My children to remain untouched, the miracles I will command, will turn their hearts inside out. This is My Promise as I call out to each of you dear little children of Mine.
I, your Beloved Father, yearn to take you, gather you and hold you close to My Heart and take you to safety.

So few of you know the depths of My Love. Once you experience love for Me, your Eternal Father, you could never sever again your link from Me.
I want to give you comfort.

I desire to let you know that My Love for you means that, through My Son Jesus Christ, great Mercy will be shown even to those with hearts of stone and to those with souls so black that only a miracle can save them.
To those who love Me I say this. Your love for Me, your Father, will be given back to you in abundance. Your love for My Precious Son will be rewarded in that I will grant immunity from the Gates of Hell to those souls for whom you pray.
Nothing is impossible.

My Love is endless.

Trust in me.

Trust in My Son.

When you do I will grant great graces for the Salvation of mankind. Your beloved Father
God the Most High

Give My Father thanks for the Gift of His Grace of Immunity from the Fires of Hell

My dearly beloved daughter I want you to ask My disciples to begin the recital, daily, of My Jesus to Mankind Litanies as and from now.
These prayers will bring great Graces and will save all those for whom you place within your special intentions for the salvation of their souls.
This second one, is in honour of My Eternal Father, who loves every one of His cherished children.

I lay My Head on His Shoulder, My Arms wrapped around Him every day, to give Him comfort as He frets for all those poor souls who are lost to Him.
Come to Him, My beloved disciples, and give My Father thanks for the Gift of His Grace of Immunity from the Fires of Hell to those who respond to His Call.
Jesus to Mankind Litany Prayer (2) For the Grace of Immunity

O Heavenly Father Most High I love You.
I honour You.
Lord Have Mercy.
Lord forgive us our trespasses.
I adore You.
I praise You.
I give You thanks for all Your special Graces.
I beg You for the Grace of Immunity for my beloved
(name all t hose in a list for the salvation of souls)

I offer You my loyalty at all times. You O Most Heavenly Father, Creator of all things,
Creator of the Universe, Creator of humanity,
You are the source of all things.
You are the source of Love.
You are Love.

I love You.
I honour You.
I lay myself before You.
I beg for Mercy for all souls who don't know You, who don't honour You,
who reject Your Hand of Mercy.
I give myself to You in mind, body and soul
so that You can take them into Your Arms, safe from evil.
I ask You to open the Gate of Paradise so that all Your children can unite, at last, in the inheritance you have created for all of us.
Amen.

I want all of you to know this.

The love My Eternal Father has for each of His children is beyond the capacity of your knowing.

It is one hundred times, or more, stronger than that which a parent holds in their hearts for their own child on earth.

So strong is the love that My Father has for His children that He has made many sacrifices which you are not aware of.

His Hand has been pulled back from inflicting many chastisements which He planned in order to punish His children.
