This month is the time when ,through the Crusade of Conversion, many people can receive the graces of instant conversion through the sacrifices made by those of you who respond to My Mother, the Mother of Salvation.
You need to be quiet this month.

Please, I urge you to visit your churches as much as you can to recite My Divine Mercy Chaplet at 3 O'Clock. Catholics please receive My Holy Eucharist every day if possible during this month.
For this month will be the time when the plans, silently underway to increase unrest in the Middle East, are being finalised.
Be strong. Be patient. Be humble of heart.

Submit your will to Me and offer your trials and sacrifices for the conversion of all sinners. Go in peace My beloved followers.
My Holy Spirit is covering you all at this time as I beckon you to this special devotion. Your beloved Jesus

Just as I was rejected the first time I will be rejected the second time
