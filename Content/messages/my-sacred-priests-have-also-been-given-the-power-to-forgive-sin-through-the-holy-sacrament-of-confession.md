To those who challenge this special gift of prayer in which I offer total absolution you must know this. I am Jesus Christ, the Son of Man and have been given the authority to forgive all sins.

I request that you accept My gift of absolution for the benefit of those who cannot receive the Sacrament of Confession or for those who are not members of the Roman Catholic Church.

Would you deny these precious souls the right to My gift?

Why would you try to discourage those souls who accept My Divine Word from receiving absolution? Would you rather they did not redeem themselves in My eyes?
You must show love to your brothers and sisters and be happy that they are being given this special gift by Me their beloved Jesus.
Even if they never read My messages given to you, My daughter, every sinner has the right to ask Me to forgive them once they show true remorse in their souls.
Open your hearts and pray for the gift of humility.

Don't you know that the Holy Spirit cannot and will not enter the souls of those with hardened hearts?
