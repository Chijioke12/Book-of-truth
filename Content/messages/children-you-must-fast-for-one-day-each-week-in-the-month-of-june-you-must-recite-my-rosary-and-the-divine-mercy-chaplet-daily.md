Crusade Prayer (59) A Pledge of Allegiance to the Divine Will

"O God the Most High, O Heavenly Father, I pledge to You my firm allegiance to honour and obey You in all things united to Your Divine Will on earth.
I, through the Sacred Blood of Your only beloved Son, the True Messiah, offer You my mind, my body and my soul on behalf of all souls, so that we can unite, as one, in Your Heavenly Kingdom to come, so that Your Divine Will is done on earth, as it is in Heaven. Amen."
