Children pour out your hearts to My Father and ask Him to protect you and cover you with the precious blood of His Son.

You must pay attention every day from now on to praying to God the Father in the name of Jesus Christ, Saviour of the World, for every protection from the evil forces now rampant in every corner.
Pray, pray, pray for the Christian Churches on earth so that they will be given the graces to defend their Faith. Never give up hope children for once you pledge allegiance to My Son and pray for strength your prayers will be answered.
Today I ask that you continue with the Conversion Crusade Prayers and the recital of the Most Holy Rosary and the Divine Mercy Chaplet.
This month is designated to the conversion of many nations.

Fasting must continue to save souls and it may be carried out according to each one's means. Continue children to pray for the conversion so needed at this time.
Thank you for responding to my call. Mother of Salvation

Remember this is a war which will be won by My Remnant Church on earth.
