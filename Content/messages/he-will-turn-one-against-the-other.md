My daughter it is unwise for those who follow My visionaries all over the world to succumb to the evil one's new plan. He intends to poison the minds of some of my chosen souls towards this mission.

He will create doubts amongst them against these Holy Messages and it will cause you much grief and sorrow.

The spiritual jealousy will mount like a beast rising from beneath the ocean and it will pour a terrible deluge of hatred not only upon My Messages but on you.
You must pray for it will happen soon.

Await these events in daily prayer and do not allow this series of attacks to discourage you.

My followers must stay alert to this for when it starts, within the next month, you too will be tempted to doubt My Holy Word.
This prophecy will unfold before you and will be the most vicious and hurtful assault on this mission so far.

Not only will the attacks spring from those who promote the messages of those they believe to be authentic modern day visionaries and prophets, they will be supported by some of My Sacred Servants.
The venom will poison many souls and many will reject Me.

Ignore these attacks My daughter. Move forward and give the world My messages as quickly as you can.

It is important that you spread My Holy Word and My prayers even among those who do not want to listen to Me. For many, when presented with these messages, will feel a compunction to do so and they will then be given graces to see the Truth.
Never ever underestimate the power of Satan's influence over you.

He targets, especially, the souls I need to help Me in My Mission to save humanity. Your beloved Saviour
Jesus Christ

Virgin Mary:Children when you suffer in this life you become closer to my Son.
