They are preparing the antichrist now, for his grand entrance
Sunday, July 21st, 2013 @ 18:05

My dearly beloved daughter, I have an important Message for the world, including those who believe in Me, those who don't, those who may not believe in My Father, as well as those who do not accept that all things come from Me.
When the beast plotted against Me, he created a diabolical plan for the end times, which is designed to fool the world with the greatest lie, in order that he can take them with him into the fires of Hell.
Know that I have already revealed to the world this plan, but there is one secret that needs to be revealed, so that you understand the Truth. As with any battle, the enemy takes up position and this is usually planned very carefully, so that it is done in secret, lest the target knows where his enemies stand.
In this, the final battle for souls, Satan and his cohorts have taken up position against God's two witnesses. This has taken many years to orchestrate, but God's children must know who the two witnesses are first, before they understand how the plan has been devised.
The enemy has now taken up position in My Church. He does this as the enemy hidden inside a Trojan horse. The enemy - and remember there are many and they all pay homage to the beast - has also taken root in the Middle East. The real target is Israel, home to the second witness.
The two witnesses are the Christians and the House of Israel. Christianity is the first target, because it came from Me. Israel is the second target, because I was born a Jew and it is the land of the chosen people of God - home to Jerusalem.
It is no accident that Satan wants to destroy these two, because he hates them and, by wiping out all traces of them, he is making the greatest statement - that he is above God. How these two witnesses will suffer in the Name of God. They will not die, but will appear to be bereft of all life.
The Sacraments will be the first to be destroyed, then the Mass, then the Bible and all traces of God's Words. During these times, many will fight to proclaim the Word of God. It will be during these times that My Graces will be poured everywhere, through the Power of the Holy Spirit, so that God is never forgotten.
The antichrist

Very soon the antichrist will make himself known as the man of peace, who will create the most ambitious peace plan in the Middle East.
They are preparing the antichrist now, for his grand entrance. Meanwhile, the diabolical plan to deceive the innocents, by teaching them lies in My Name, continues. To those of you who will not accept the Truth, know that these times are upon you. If you cannot accept the Truth now, if you truly love Me, then I will give you the Graces to discern.
So many cannot see this wicked plan, so carefully concealed, but, which is unfolding before your eyes, as foretold. Holy Scripture never lies. My Word is the Truth. The Truth is your lifeline towards salvation. If you accept the lies, given to you in My Church, by those who do not come in My Name, then you will fall into great darkness and you will be devoured by such wickedness, that should you partake in such occult practices - presented to you in My Name - you will be lost to Me.
Very soon, when the false peace is created, plans will commence to annihilate the Jews. While the beast savages Israel, the false prophet will discard My Presence and deceive not just Catholics, but all Christians, all religions, in order to idolize the beast under the guise of the One World Religion.
If this Message strikes fear in your souls, then know that it is My intention not to hide anything from you, which could destroy you. All that is important is that you remain true to My Teachings and pray for My Protection. When you surrender to Me, your Jesus and ask Me to guide you, all will be well.
I will keep you within My Protection - all those of you, who do not deviate from the Truth. Your Jesus

Trust Me and I will open your eyes to the Truth of your glorious future
Monday, July 22nd, 2013 @ 19:09

My dearly beloved daughter, I call out to all the young people in the world, of all creeds and all faiths.

I Am Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world and I will make Myself known to you, soon. Once this happens, during a supernatural event, which will be experienced all over the world at the same time, you will know the Truth.
You may not accept My Call to you now. You may not welcome Me in your day to day lives, but when you feel My Love, nothing else will matter to you again. The time for the Second Coming is close. This event, when I come to bring Peace, as I herald in the New Paradise, will overwhelm you with a joy, which you have never before experienced. I will bring you a life beyond your dreams - a life which when glimpsed will be all that you desire.
The Second Coming is not to be feared, as it will be the most powerful, joyous occasion. This is My Promise. You must never worry or feel that life is over - that you will be denied the time you take for granted in the world - because life will only be beginning. This time there will be no torment, hurt, anger, hate or division. Only love will thrive and with it, a life of splendour, where you will live in great unity, in love and peace with your loved ones.
I Am preparing the world for this Great Event, which has been prophesised. In order to prepare - so that in the blink of an eye, the world will change for good - you must come to Me. To be given this life in the New Paradise, where you will retain a perfect body and soul, you must ask Me to cleanse your soul. In order for Me to do this, you must ask Me to forgive you your sins. It is this simple. I know you are a sinner. You know that you are a sinner, but this must never separate you from Me.
If you are troubled or fearful, then tell Me your worries and I will soothe your pain. Trust Me and I will open your eyes to the Truth of your glorious future. When the Earth is renewed and the Second Coming is announced, I will be waiting to greet you. I will always love you, because it was for you that I gave up My Body, when I allowed them to crucify Me. If I love you so much, then nothing should stand in your way to call on Me today.
I await your call.

Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: The last secret of Fatima was not revealed, so terrifying was it
Monday, July 22nd, 2013 @ 20:17

My child, the deceit, which the world will face, will be so difficult to discern, that only those who surrender to God and place all their trust in my Son, will be able to endure the trials, which lie ahead.
I gave the world the prophecies in 1917, but the last secret of Fatima was not revealed, so terrifying was it for those within the Catholic Church.
The last secret of Fatima still remains unknown to God's children, although part of it was revealed to you on 26 January, 2012. Very few within the Church are privy to this. Now, the next part of the final secret of Fatima must be revealed, so that I can warn humanity of the consequences of ignoring my intervention to help save souls.
The Church has been infested, from the inside, by enemies of God. They - and there are twenty of them who control from within - have created the greatest deceit. They have elected a man, not of God, while the Holy Father, accorded the Crown of Peter, has been carefully removed.
The details, which I revealed, are that there would be two men wearing the Crown of Peter in the end times. One will suffer because of lies which have been created to discredit him and which will render him a virtual prisoner. The other one elected will bring about the destruction, not only of the Catholic Church, but of all churches which honour my Father and who accept the Teachings of my Son, Jesus Christ, Saviour of the world.
There can only be one head of the Church on Earth, authorised by my Son, who must remain pope until his death. Anyone else, who claims to sit in the Seat of Peter, is an imposter. This deceit has one purpose, to turn souls over to Lucifer and there is little time for such souls, who will be none the wiser, to be saved.
Children, you must only heed one warning, now. Do not deviate from the Teachings of my Son. Question every new doctrine, which may be presented to you and which professes to come from my Son's Church on Earth. The Truth is simple. It never changes. My Son's Legacy is very clear. Do not allow anyone to cloud your judgement.
Soon the Fatima prophecies will make sense. All is now taking place before a disbelieving world, but sadly, very few will understand until it is too late. Pray, pray, pray my Most Holy Rosary, as often as possible, every single day, in order to dilute the effect of the evil, which surrounds you.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

I reveal the secrets contained within the Book of Revelation, and they will not be pleasant
Tuesday, July 23rd, 2013 @ 15:30

My dearly beloved daughter, the trials you will have to face are because I reveal the secrets contained within the Book of Revelation and they will not be pleasant. The Truth can be so upsetting and unsettling for many. The Truth will cause tears of dismay, tears of sadness and great distress.
Lies, on the other hand, can lull you into a sense of false security. Even when lies, presented to you, come dressed in loving language and noble gestures, don't feel right in your heart, they can be much easier for man to accept than the Truth.
When someone is told that they have been infected with a terminal disease, they have two choices. They can accept the Truth, prepare their souls, spend time in close proximity with their families, seek My Forgiveness and then, wait for the day. When they do this, although it may be frightening, they will - because they have accepted the Truth - find true peace in their souls. These souls will have nothing to fear from Me. If, on the other hand, they reject the Truth, and believe in magic potions and false gods, which they think can be used to miraculously cure them, they will be very disappointed. These souls, blinded by so-called positive thoughts, believe that if they will themselves to be better, that all will be well. What they fail to understand is that they must call on Me, Jesus, if they wish to be healed. I will answer prayers, but only if the request is for the good of their souls. These souls, who refuse to accept the Truth of their illness and who do not turn to Me, will be lost. They will have wasted the time accorded to them on Earth, to ensure that their house is in order.
The same is true of My Word, the Truth, given to you, now. I gave the world the Truth, during My Time on Earth and I was rejected. Many did follow Me, but the Truth, given to them at that time, will now be challenged by the enemies of God and they will fall prey to deceit. They will soon reject the Truth and will not be able to accept My Warning, given to the world at this time.
I call on you now, not to reveal to you new Teachings, as this is not necessary. You were given the Truth, but now I intervene to remind you of the Truth. I also come to warn you of the evil atrocities, which will be inflicted on you because of your love for Me.
Do not turn your backs on Me, Jesus Christ, as I Am reaching out only to protect you at this time. I do not want to alienate you, but I will keep reminding you of the Truth, time and time again. When you find that your soul becomes agitated, as a result of the new rules to be presented by those who say they are of Me, then you must call on Me through this Crusade Prayer.
Crusade Prayer (116) Save me from the evil of lies:

Dear Jesus, help me.

I am drowning in tears of sorrow.

My heart is confused.

I do not know who I can trust.

Please fill me with Your Holy Spirit, so that I can choose the correct path to Your Kingdom.

Help me, dear Jesus, to always remain true to Your Word, given to the world by Peter and to never deviate from what You taught us or deny Your death on the Cross.
Jesus, You are the Way.

Show me the Way.

Hold me and carry me on Your journey of Great Mercy. Amen.

Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: Just as if a miracle has taken place, the false prophet will seem to rise from the dead
Thursday, July 25th, 2013 @ 18:52

My child, it is important my children do not lose courage when faced with the hurt they will have to face, as my Son's Church will be cast into the wilderness of the desert.
I am the Woman in the Book of Revelation, clothed with the sun, who gave birth to the Child. The Child is Jesus. The Mystical Body of my Son, Jesus, is His Church on Earth. My Son's Church is being stolen and soon His Body will no longer be present therein. This desolation will tear the hearts of those, who follow the Teachings of my Son, in two. Those, who will have nowhere to turn, will find themselves cast out of the buildings which have, up to now, housed the Holy Eucharist. But, while they will have been thrown out, with little mercy shown to them, they will be filled with the Holy Spirit. This means that they will be guided and will lead fiercely the Remnant Army, which is made up of those who are loyal to God.
Others, blind to the Truth, will follow the false prophet into disarray. Their hearts will be deceived, and soon, when the false prophet will be seen to be at death's door, they will sob. But then, just as if a miracle has taken place, the false prophet will seem to rise from the dead. They will say that he is blessed with great, supernatural powers from Heaven and they will fall flat on their faces before him in adoration. He will be loved and adored by those who cannot see.
Soon the antichrist will appear and his rise to fame will start in Jerusalem. Once he appears in public, everything in my Son's Church will change, quickly. The new rules will be introduced. New relics, changes in the garments worn by priests and many new regulations will be enforced. At first, people will say that all these changes stem from a need to be humble. And,
while these abominations enter the Christian churches, the persecution will begin. Dare to object to these Satanic rituals and you will be deemed a heretic - a troublemaker.
Many cardinals, bishops, priests, nuns and ordinary people will be excommunicated, if they do not follow the new rules or adore the false prophet. At this stage you must seek out refuges, which will have been created, so that you can worship my Son, Jesus Christ, in peace. Priests must continue to administer the Sacraments and provide my children with the Most Holy Eucharist.
You must never give in to the deceit, which you will be asked to take part in. Those who do will lose their souls to the evil one. Your beloved Mother

Although they will cause fear, they are nothing when compared to the Great Chastisement ahead
Thursday, July 25th, 2013 @ 20:40

My dearly beloved daughter, the Hand of My Father has now intervened in the world, in punishment for the sin of man. Sin has escalated in the world because man no longer differentiates between right and wrong. You cannot escape the Wrath of My Father's Anger, when your countries applaud wicked sin, through their laws.
These punishments will be witnessed across the world, quickly. Although they will cause fear, they are nothing when compared to the Great Chastisement ahead. Man is stubborn. He refuses help when it is offered by God. Humanity has chosen to reject God and every single one of you has suffered because of the heathens amongst you.
My Call from Heaven is to save all souls in the first instance, but it is also so that I can help you to mitigate the punishments, which will befall the human race. How great is My Mercy. How great is My Patience, but those who reject My Teachings and who shut themselves off from My Father, their Creator, will soon know the consequences.
I call out to all religions and beg you to pray for clemency, whether you accept these Messages or not. The prayers are necessary to mitigate the catastrophes, which have already begun. Pray, pray, pray, for your lives and for the salvation of your souls.
Your Jesus

Look behind the mask of humanism and you will not find signs of God
Saturday, July 27th, 2013 @ 19:22

My dearly beloved daughter, it is My Desire that all My cherished followers pray hard to deflect the harm to souls, because of the growth of atheism. Atheism does not always declare itself. Very often, people who have decided, for whatever reason, to no longer believe in God, create a substitute.
Because of the makeup of man, he must seek out a cause in order to justify his existence. The curse of humanism is that it exalts man in the eyes of man. All that must be done, according to the humanist, is to ensure that man's needs come first. Many people confuse humanism with Christianity. When one proclaims the importance of worldly goods in the lives of man, at all cost, in order to avoid suffering or poverty, it is easy to assume that this is a form of love for one's neighbour.
If you say that you want to put a stop to poverty, unemployment and other miseries, many will think you are speaking in the Name of God. Look behind the mask of humanism and you will not find signs of God, nor will you hear His Name
mentioned. Those who live their lives as humanists do not love God. They only love themselves. They also believe that all that matters is the wellbeing - usually in the form of worldly things - of humanity, as a means to an end.
While it may seem charitable, to be seen to care about the needs of man, you can never substitute God, by placing the needs of man first. When you do this, you insult God. Humanism, while having all the exterior signs of love for God, is not what it seems. Behind the mask of love lurks a love of self. Man will die, his body will turn to dust, his soul will live on, yet, humanism would have you believe that man is immortal.
Be careful when you embrace humanism, because when you do, you cut yourselves off from Me. Your Jesus

To the other innocents, who blindly follow the beast and the false prophet, they will be locked into a savage bond
Sunday, July 28th, 2013 @ 21:40

My dearly beloved daughter, you must never doubt My Word. You must, if you truly trust Me, do what it is I desire of you, so that I can enlighten the world, at this time, and prepare them for the New Beginning.
Much of what is happening to My Church has been foretold, but you must accept that My Father allows these abominations for a reason. This is the final end of the reign of Satan. He has raised up a beast, in his name, and this antichrist is the spirit of Satan himself. He and his followers have been given very little time in the great battle for souls.
Satan's revenge is to steal as many souls as he is capable of, before he is chained and thrown into the abyss. Those of his cohorts, who idolize the serpent, only follow his instructions because of the power he tells them will be theirs, if they help him complete his diabolical plan. How these poor souls will suffer for eternity and how they will scream for My Mercy when the awful realisation of their fate becomes clear.
To the other innocents, who blindly follow the beast and the false prophet, they will be locked into a savage bond, from which they will be powerless to escape. They are in desperate need of your help. You must pray hard for their souls to be released back to Me. To the outside world, they won't see much to alarm them, at first. The wars in the Middle East and the subsequent peace will be greeted with applause.
The man of peace will receive many awards in acknowledgement of his humanitarian works. The false prophet will be seen to be uniting the churches of the world and displaying, at every opportunity, all those attributes, which you associate with a saint.
All will be well, until these two turn and with a vengeance strike down all those who oppose their plan to control the world. They will weave My Church on Earth into the nest of the beast, until darkness covers the Earth.
All will feel a disquiet. All of you will feel the evil, as Satan, through the antichrist, controls all. But then, just as things will seem hopeless, I will descend, through My Great Mercy, to envelop all, to prove to the world the Truth.
So great is My Mercy, that I will enlighten the darkest of souls and they will come to Me with relief in their hearts. At that stage, all their doubts will be driven out of their souls, by the Power of the Holy Spirit. Soon afterwards, as God's children know the Truth, the Final Trumpet will peal out and the Earth will be renewed. All evil will disappear. The sun will fill all of you with a Great Light and the New Paradise will be handed, with great love, as the greatest Gift you could ever imagine, to each and every one of you.
All you need to do is trust in the Truth I reveal, so that you can avoid the traps which are to be laid down to steal your souls. Those of you who can see, who trust Me, who call on Me, will help Me save the souls of those who can see, but who refuse to see the Truth.
Your Jesus

The mark of the beast will bring with it death - death of the soul and death by a terrible disease
Monday, July 29th, 2013 @ 11:23

My dearly beloved daughter, My Name is rarely mentioned in the same breath, as those who claim to represent Me shout blasphemies against God. My death on the Cross will not only be dismissed and not spoken about, but the images of demons will be used as a substitute for My Corpus on the Cross. If it is not Me they killed on the Cross, then who is it? Who are they, who proclaim My Word to the world, but who utter profanities, which spill from their mouths?
Beware of the miracles the men in white robes will claim to perform, as if they are made of My Flesh and blessed with My Spirit. When you see wondrous and seemingly miraculous events take place, know that they are nothing of the sort.
You will be told that miracles have been created by the hand of the false prophet. You will then be expected to show great respect and you will be told, at first, that he is a living saint. He will be worshipped, loved and admired and all will say that he is favoured by God. They will believe, in time, that these miracles are taking place to herald My Second Coming.
And then, the beast will appear. And he will honour the first one. And the world will be caught up in terrible confusion. They will be trapped. On the one hand, the false prophet will control all religions in the world and prey on the love of those who know the Truth. Those who do know the Truth, will not reject Me, for theirs is the Kingdom of God. The antichrist will show great honour towards the false prophet. But, because his role will be a political one, their allegiance will unite many people who will applaud this alliance.
These events will begin to make sense soon. Those who try to take you away with them into a false faith, not of God, will be very convincing. They will never reveal their true intent, until they believe they are winning this battle. But then, they will destroy many, who refuse to accept the mark of the beast. They will say that this will be a sign of true world peace, love and unity, but hidden within its vile core will be the number 666, the sign of the beast.
Just as holy medals offer protection from Heaven with Power from God, the mark of the beast will bring with it death - death of the soul and death by a terrible disease. Those who refuse it will have to hide and prepare. I know this is frightening, but it is true. I will intervene with the help of your prayers to put an end to the persecution.
You, my beloved followers, who know the Truth, are being prepared to help those who will struggle with this knowledge. By the time this happens, My Remnant Army, will be a force to be reckoned with. Their strength will lie in their ability to save those who will suffer by this diabolical act of revenge on God's children.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: You must hold on to traditional Crosses, for soon they will disappear
Monday, July 29th, 2013 @ 19:05

My children, always remember that, by the Power of God and by the Grace of my Son, I will crush the beast and when all seems hopeless, the reign of the evil one will come to an abrupt end.
My Veil of Protection covers all those who call on my help, during these difficult times. Remember, that just as I lost my Son, when He was twelve years of age, I found Him in the Temple. Pray, my children, and go into your churches, now, to offer up the sacrifices needed to ask for perseverance during this terrible spiritual battle for souls.
My Son has suffered so much by His death on the Cross, but this was only one burden. The greatest suffering He endures today is for those already lost to Him. And now, as the spirit of evil strives to take away from Him all those who love Him, His Pain sears through Him like a sword, cutting Him in two.
Victim souls will now suffer the greatest pain, as the persecution against God's children mounts. By my Son's Cross, you have been saved. By His Cross you will fight evil and His Cross, when blessed, will protect you. But, if this Cross changes or appears different, it is a mockery of my Son's death to save sinners.You must hold on to traditional Crosses for soon they will disappear.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

Never accept a cross, which does not resemble the Cross, upon which I was crucified
Tuesday, July 30th, 2013 @ 20:06

My dearly beloved daughter, how sweet are the voices of those who love Me and who comfort Me in this time of great sorrow. You, My beloved followers, who will never desert Me, are like honey, sweet in My Mouth, soothing My Body and lifting My Spirit.
Many will follow the falsities, because they will be afraid to stand up and defiantly defend the Word of God. At first, they will be confused, by the new practices, new symbols, new garments, new formats for altars and new crosses. Then they will accept all these new things, as signs of the times. This new, modern, so-called unified approach to honour God, will be then enthusiastically embraced by those poor souls. But those who are Mine will stay true to My Word, for all ages. They are the backbone of My Church on Earth and they will never break.
My desire is that you, My loyal Christians - of all denominations - gather together to fight the demons, which have been unleashed from Hell and who roam amongst you. Never apologise for loving Me. Never accept a cross, which does not resemble the Cross, upon which I was crucified. When I Am missing, or Am not mentioned, then you will know that infestation spreads throughout these Churches, which has been masterminded by My enemies. If you do accept their satanic rituals and symbols, you will leave yourselves exposed to evil.
Stay true to Me. Keep your daily prayers simple. Keep Holy Water and My Cross in your homes. Protect each other. Stay obedient to those sacred servants of Mine, who will remain fiercely loyal to Me and who refuse to betray Me. Then spend the rest of your time praying for the souls of atheists, those who believe in pagan gods and those who will blindly follow the enemies of My Church into the wilderness.
Remain in close union with Me and call on Me every day for strength. I will be at your side during these bitter trials ahead and I will never forsake those who seek Me out.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: Just as the Holy Word of God can unite souls, so too can it cause great division
Wednesday, July 31st, 2013 @ 18:31

My child, when you love my Son, Jesus Christ, it will bring all those who truly love Him close together. When those who love my Son find it difficult to love others, they need to call on Me, the Mother of Salvation, to open their hearts.
The Love of my Son is so powerful, that with the Power of the Holy Spirit, it can spread so quickly from one corner of the world into every part. When my Son's Holy Word is given to all of God's children, through this Mission, it will tear through the hearts of humble souls, who recognize the Saviour as He speaks. The Love, which emanates from His Word, given to you at this time in the history of mankind, will unite millions of souls, instantly, as if you were known to each other all your lives. So powerful is it, that it can, through the power of tongues, spread from nation to nation, in all languages, quickly. This is how you know that these Words, through these Messages, come from my Son.
Just as the Holy Word of God can unite souls, so too can it cause great division. The hatred, which ensues as the Word of God devours souls, is at its worst. When these Messages attract such hatred and wicked actions, by those who call themselves true disciples of my Son, know then that it is the evil one who causes this. My poor souls, my poor confused children, you must never turn your back when you are unsure of my Son's Words. You must keep an open mind and remain true to what He taught you. Do not judge anyone in His Name. Love one another. If you do not believe that God has sent His final prophet, then it does not matter. Please remember though, your obligation - by carrying out your duties to my Son, by adhering strictly to His Teachings.
You must never accept that He would bless any new doctrine, which He did not give the world when He walked the Earth. He would never condone anything, which substitutes His death on the Cross on the altars of the world.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

They will convince My followers to adapt the Laws of My Church by holding a referendum
Wednesday, July 31st, 2013 @ 18:56

My dearly beloved daughter, always remember how the devil works. He is very careful not to reveal himself. He, therefore, mixes truths and lies together, in order to confuse. This is his favourite way to deceive souls. He would never tell the truth, by allowing others to see how he really is, but because he is proud, his arrogance and his hatred for Me will always seep out. Those whose eyes are open will immediately recognize the insults, which are thrown in My Face and before My altars.
Satan, remember, is proud, arrogant, boastful and very, very cunning. When he is present in souls, he has a confidence, which is borne out of pride and arrogance and a belief that he is above God. He will always give signs, which insult God, but only those who know what to look for will see them.Those who honour Satan, and who spend much of their time in groups which organize rituals to pay homage to him, will be delighted to see these signs. All who have sold their souls to Satan will communicate, through such signs, as an arrogant and defiant gesture against Me, Jesus Christ.
Those who deceive you, in My Name, will convince My followers to adapt the Laws of My Church, by holding a referendum. All will be asked to condone new practices, which amount to two things. The first is to wipe out My Presence in the Holy Eucharist. The second is to condone sin, by encouraging people to show sympathy for the human rights of those who do not believe in Jesus Christ.
This referendum will be falsified and lies will be presented as the Truth. When the new one world religion is introduced, My Church on Earth - the True Church - will go into hiding, in order to pay homage to Me.
I Am the target of the beast. I Am Who he wants to hurt. He knows he cannot destroy Me, so he will instead try to destroy the human race, who he curses every second. His servants will not stop by just insulting My Presence in the Tabernacles of the world. They will not be happy to destroy only the Sacraments, so that they can blaspheme against Me. They will only be happy when they steal souls by creating the greatest blasphemy of all. This is when they will recreate My First Coming by giving the impression that John the Baptist has been sent. The man who will say he is the Lord's prophet will lie and cause such wonder when he declares that the antichrist is Me, Jesus Christ.
The antichrist will, through the power of Satan, claim to be Me, Jesus Christ. Woe to those souls who welcome him into their arms, for they will be powerless against him. Allow these two to suck you into their vacuum of lies and you will be so far removed from Me that only by the Intervention of My Father can you be brought into My Great Mercy.
When anyone who comes in the future, and claims to be Me, Jesus Christ, know that he is a liar. I will not come in the flesh a second time. Satan cannot utter these words:
"Jesus Christ, Who came in the flesh."

What he will say, through the mouth of the beast, the antichrist, will be the following:

"I am Jesus Christ, I have now come in the flesh, to bring you salvation."

When this happens My Divine Intervention will be swift, but by then the false prophet and the antichrist will have stolen many souls.
Pray, pray, pray that all those who say they are Mine remain Mine.

Pray that you will all have the strength and courage to carry My Cross during the greatest persecution of My Body - My Mystical Body - My Church on Earth at this time.
Your Jesus

The wickedness present in the world is on a scale not seen since the days of Noah
Thursday, August 1st, 2013 @ 15:00

My dearly beloved daughter, how I yearn to embrace all of you dear followers of Mine and take you into My Refuge of peace and safety. How I wish I could take you all and hide you from the wickedness, which is being plotted against all Christians.
The wickedness present in the world is on a scale not seen since the days of Noah and it is like an invisible net, which covers the Earth. So lethal is it that very few really understand the level of sophistication involved. But be aware, this plan - the details of which will be given to the world - by those who say that they represent My churches on Earth - will be brought before you and you will be expected to accept it. Then you will be demanded to devour it and you will be given no choice. What you will be asked to do, behind all the garble, is to deny Me, Jesus Christ.
I warn the world, that when you try to dismiss My Divinity - you and all those involved in this devious plot - you will be marked as an enemy of God. When you side with blasphemous laws, you are guilty of sin against God.
I will continue to warn you, to open your eyes to the Truth, but I cannot force you to remain true to Me. I cannot force you to love Me. Your free will is your own, but if you turn and ask Me to guide you, I will open your eyes to the Truth. When you accept the Truth I will save you.
My poor followers, know that as the world will turn against God, that the Almighty Power of My Father will intervene and destroy His enemies one by one.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: Soon you will be asked to give out a substitute for the Holy Eucharist, which will not be the Body of my Son.
Friday, August 2nd, 2013 @ 15:10

My child, I stand before my Son, at this time, and fall on my face at His Feet in great sorrow. Just as I had to witness His Agony at the foot of His Cross, during His terrifying Crucifixion, I now have to endure His Pain once again.
My Son's Crucifixion is taking place again as His Body, His Mystical Body, which is His Church on Earth, has to endure a scourging by His own. They, the enemies within His Church, will scourge His Body, tear It apart, mock Him cruelly and desecrate It, before they throw It aside. My Son's Church is now to be scourged, during what will be the first stage of His Crucifixion on Earth in these times. They will take His Body - through the Holy Eucharist - and insult Him as well as degrade Him. Many signs will be seen of this, as every disrespectful and devious gesture will be made, in order to curse Him. When they have vilified His Most Holy Eucharist, they will then throw It away and soon It will be very difficult to receive It. This is just one of the many plans underway to wipe out my Son's Presence in the Holy Mass.
Many will see these wicked gestures and know that they are insulting to my Son. Many will protest, but their voices will not be heard. To those poor priests, who will suffer because of this desecration, you must ask me, your Mother, to help you endure such pain. You must never ever tamper with the Holy Eucharist, for It is your only Food of Salvation. Without It, you will starve. It must always be made available to every single one of God's children. You must never accept that any other kind of bread is the Food of Life.
Soon you will be asked to give out a substitute for the Holy Eucharist, which will not be the Body of my Son. You must remain true to the Gift of the Holy Eucharist even when you are told that It is no longer relevant - no longer acceptable in the new world religion.
Your Mother in Christ Mother of Salvation

God the Father: The names of those in the Book of the Living are the primary target of the beast
Saturday, August 3rd, 2013 @ 13:17

My dearest daughter, I Call on humanity from the Highest and Most Holy Realm.

My poor little children, how you suffer for the sin of Lucifer, but you must know that, by My Almighty Power, I will wipe him and all the fallen angels off the face of the Earth. That time is close, so you must prepare.
Know that the fallen angels and demons are unknown and invisible to most of you, but they walk amongst you, tempting you every day so that you will fall. When you are taken into this web of deceit, soon you will find that you will be unable to rest or find true peace in your souls.
I declare that those who are led astray by the false prophet will find themselves lost and confused as they accept the great deceit, in which they will become willing victims. When you turn on Me and My beloved Son, Jesus Christ, it will not appear to you that this is the case. You will believe that the Sacraments are the same, although they will be presented to you differently. They will become empty vessels and will no longer be acceptable by Me.
The world is Mine, yet My children do not want Me, their beloved Father, their Creator. Their minds have been blocked and the evil one has used My Gift of intelligence to tempt them into believing that I could not possibly Exist. Those who do not believe in Me will have no real love, joy or peace in their lives. Nor will they accept Eternal Life. Instead, they will seek out only pleasures of the flesh, although they know that their lives on Earth are short.
I will, as a Father Who loves each of them, pull them to Me through the Great Mercy of My Son. My Power is all-encompassing and Satan, My Lucifer, who cut himself away from My Hip, because of his pride, will never defeat Me. Those who follow him, therefore, have driven the same wedge between themselves and Me. They will know by the signs I now reveal that there is only One God, One Creator, one Paradise. All the paradises they are told about, by the false prophets in the world, who lead My children away from Me, do not, nor can they ever exist. I Am all there is. I created all. I will end all. All must be according to My Holy Will. Fight My Will and you will become nothing. Accept My Will and you remain My child.
To those who do believe in Me, you must never reject My Son, Jesus Christ. I came into the world through My Son to bring you back into My Mercy, but you rejected Him. You killed Him, but still you never killed My Love for you. This is why I allowed His Crucifixion to bring you salvation. This, My Son's death on the Cross, became your way to salvation. His death was not what it seemed - a failure in the eyes of the evil one. It was through this act of great suffering, endured with the greatest humility, which defeated Satan. And it was because of My Son's death on the Cross, that Satan's power over humanity failed. Even though he cannot take all of My children with him into the abyss, many will still be seduced by his lies. This is why you must fight, children, not just for your own souls. If you love Me, you will love My Son. If you love My Son, then you must help Him to save all sinners.
I Call on you to tell you that when I Call on souls, especially those who do not know Me, as well as those who do know Me, but who refuse to accept My Commandments, that they have only so much time to save themselves from eternal torture.
The names of those in the Book of the Living are the primary target of the beast. Many of these souls are followers of My Son and are loyal to the Church. They will turn on My Son by accepting new laws, not of My Son, which they will be forced to swallow as a new religion. This new religion has been carefully planned for many years. It follows Satanic rituals, but many will not understand this. When you embrace these rituals, you will give power to Satan. When you give him this power, you will need much prayer, for he will devour you in body as well as in soul.
My children, I intervene now through punishments on the Earth. The poor souls who lose their lives through these chastisements are helping to save those of you who are lost to Me.
When you feel frightened by the wickedness of Satan and his influence in your lives, remember that I will destroy his representatives on Earth. I will cut short your suffering, because I wish to save souls. If I allowed this evil to continue, I would not be able to salvage all those souls whose names are in the Book of the Living.
Your beloved Father God the Most High

My Prophecies, which reveal the arrival of the antichrist, are soon to be realised
Sunday, August 4th, 2013 @ 23:16

My dearly beloved daughter, My Prophecies, which reveal the arrival of the antichrist, are soon to be realised.

The day for all of you to prepare your houses and your routine of prayers is upon you and all who follow Me must be willing to make sacrifices, in order to help Me to open the eyes of God's children everywhere to this wickedness, which will turn the world upside down.
Just as any true prophet is despised and treated as a nuisance, you, My dear followers, will be seen as an annoyance when you reveal the Truth. Expect ridicule, mockery and contempt, at every corner you turn. People who surround you will bully you, criticize you and find fault, even when you do not even speak with them about My Word.
Every fallen angel and demon, who infiltrate the Earth at this time, will, through weak souls, be immediately drawn to you, in order to discourage you from this Work.
Accept this grief in My Name, for when you do, you give great glory to God and it is one of the greatest gifts you can give Me. I then use these trials of yours to defeat Satan by claiming souls, which are destined to become his.
Very few understand the Divine Laws of Heaven and the role of the Cross in your lives. Someday, all of God's children will understand why these cruel actions must be endured. Continue with the task of spreading the Truth, ignore the hatred you will witness and do not accept direction from those who deny Me - ever.
Your march towards the New Paradise will be difficult. But with only a small army, you can defeat the severity of the punishments, which will be handed out by the antichrist upon the world. Your task is to warn others of the dangers of accepting the laws of Satan as a substitute for the Laws of God.
Only by the Command of My Father can I take with Me all of those whose names are in the Book of the Living, but who will give their allegiance to the false prophet and, with a docile acceptance, fall for the appealing demeanour of the antichrist.
Your Jesus

When they change the Sacrament of Baptism, they will remove all promises to renounce Satan for they will declare these references to be old-fashioned
Monday, August 5th, 2013 @ 04:05

My dearly beloved daughter, let no man believe during the persecution, which My beloved sacred servants - who remain loyal to Me - will have to endure, that My Church can ever die. For this is impossible. My Church - My Mystical Body - has Eternal Life.
When My enemies change the Sacraments and introduce new relics, new crosses and new practices - and then say that My Church remains as it has always been - they are lying. My Church can never change.
So many arguments will be made, in every nation, in order to defile the Sacrament of Marriage. They, the enemies of God, want Christians to accept marriage between couples of the same sex, but they must never accept this, as it offends My Father. It is not acceptable in His Eyes. When they change the Sacrament of Baptism, they will remove all promises to renounce Satan, for they will declare these references to be old-fashioned and too frightening. They will say it is irrelevant.
Then they will, bit by bit, introduce new versions of My Teachings. You, all of you who believe in My Church, must never betray Me. You must never accept any substitute for the Sacraments as I gave them to you. I Am the Truth. My Church represents the Truth. But you can only claim to be part of My Church if you retain all of My Teachings, My Sacraments and accept that My death on the Cross was the greatest Sacrifice to secure your salvation.
Anything, which deviates from the Truth, for fear of insulting pagans, is very dangerous. When you deny the Teachings of God and follow a new, alternative Church, you will no longer remain part of My Church on Earth. If you object to the new pagan practices, which will be introduced by the false prophet, you will be deemed a heretic. Then they will try to excommunicate you, in My Name. If you remain loyal to Me and refuse to take part in this wicked deceit, you will remain part of My Church.
The choice may be painful, when all these things come about, but it is very simple. You are either for Me or against Me. Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: This war, to uphold the Word of God, will mean that those priests, who do remain true to Him, will have to seek refuge
Monday, August 5th, 2013 @ 13:05

My dear children, this is going to be a time of great trials in your faith. The Catholic Church will be the Church in which the great division will commence. It will be in this Church that My Son's priests will suffer the most, during the great apostasy, which it will, very soon, have to endure from within.
To those of my Son's faithful priests, who will be torn in two by indecision, you must be aware of the need to remain in union with the Merciful Christ.You must never feel tempted to desert His Church, by accepting falsities from those amongst you who have fallen into grave error. You must revere my Son at all costs and lead His people on the path to holiness, no matter how difficult this will be for you.
Those of you who will continue to perform the traditional Mass will be tormented until you agree to abandon it entirely. Many amongst your religious orders will betray you to the enemy behind your back. You will, just like my Son before you, be taken before those who claim to be your peers and be accused of heresy, for insisting on continuing to show respect for the most Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.
The new words, which will amount to the most vile desecration of my Son's Body, will be forced down upon those sacred servants who dare to object.
It will be within the Catholic Church that brother will fight brother, sister against sister, father against son, children against parent, until there are two sides.
This war, to uphold the Word of God, will mean that those priests, who do remain true to Him, will have to seek refuge. To do this you must start preparing and find such places where you will be able to offer the Holy Mass and provide the Sacraments to God's children.
I, the Mother of Salvation, will protect such refuges and by the placement of the Seal of the Living God, given to the world by My Father, on the inside walls, they will remain invisible to the enemies of God.
Do not be afraid of these things, because if you prepare well, you will lead God's children to salvation. Should you not heed this warning, you will be taken captive in mind, body and soul, by the enemies of my Son and salvation will not be yours.
Those who do the bidding of the false prophet will need much prayer, for some of them are blind to the Truth. Others, who will know the Truth, but who will side with those who will deny my Son's death on the Cross, are to be feared. They will inflict terrible harm on the innocent followers of Christ.
By remaining loyal to the Truth, you will lead my Son's Remnant Army, so that it becomes a formidable force, against the evil one and those he directs in his fight against my Son's true servants on Earth.
You must, when the time comes, refuse to accept direction from those who will desecrate the Word of God and through their lies and new obscene doctrines, will mislead many. Those who accept any distortion of the Mass or the Holy Sacraments, will be answerable to my Son. For you will have become, unwitting, servants to the evil one and many, many, souls will be lost, for they will be drawn into rituals, which will pay homage to Satan. These rituals will honour the false prophet and the antichrist, who are enemies of God.
Pray, pray, pray that the Truth will be seen and that lies will be exposed for what they are - an affront to my Son's agonizing Crucifixion.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

When you defend My Word, you will be deemed to be cruel, unkind and lacking in sympathy to those who do not believe in God
Monday, August 5th, 2013 @ 18:33

My dearly beloved daughter, how I weep with sadness when I see the terrible division which looms within My Church on Earth. The bitterness of My Agony is eased though, by those who truly love Me and who already feel concern for the way in which My Body is being treated.
You must never feel the need to accept any deed, action or words which are against Me. If you feel uncomfortable with what you witness, within my Church, by those who swear that they are in union with Me, when they desecrate My Body, you must follow your heart. I Am with you every second of this great apostasy and for those who will continue to call out to Me, I will open your eyes to the Truth, so that you will remain true to Me.
The time is almost upon you now. The doors of My Church will soon be closed to those who will insist on remaining loyal to the traditional practices of Christianity. These doors will be slammed in your faces when you bear witness to Me. Your faith will be ridiculed, in the most cunning way, so that when you defend My Word, you will be deemed to be cruel, unkind and lacking in sympathy to those who do not believe in God.
You will be scolded if you are a sacred servant of Mine and you will be made to answer for your allegiance to Me. Gather now, all of you. I demand that you do not deny Me. I will protect you, so that you can serve Me. I will help you by lifting your burden. All the Graces of Heaven will be poured down upon you.
Warning to Priests:

I will cut down all those of you who follow the false church - the church of the beast - when it is presented to you. Follow this new church and you will be selling your souls to the beast. Instead of saving souls, in My Name, you will be responsible for handing them over to eternal Hell.
I Am telling you the Truth now, so that you are given ample time to prepare for this day, as it is not far away. Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: Do not accept tolerance for pagans to take over the churches of God
Tuesday, August 6th, 2013 @ 19:37

My child, you must never listen to those who attack these Messages from the Blessed Trinity, for they will distract you from this Work. Remember, this Mission will be attacked more than any other, because of the seriousness of It. The mockery, the ridicule and the criticism, will continue right up to the last day when you receive the Final Message.
The plan to discredit these Messages will intensify and hatred will mount, so please be prepared. These Messages cannot be ignored by believers, or unbelievers, for the Word of God will never go unnoticed. The hatred against God in the world right now is everywhere and those who proclaim His Word in these times will suffer.
The Truth has always been rejected since God sent His prophets in the beginning to warn His children of the dangers of paganism. Paganism is the antithesis of the Truth - the Word of God. Those poor souls, who honour false gods, anger My Father, greatly. He is a jealous God, for it was through Him that all things began. He is Almighty. He is a loving God, but His Wrath is to be feared when pagans infest those who love Him.
When God's children - those who believe in Him, and who adore Him, through His beloved Son, Jesus Christ - try to unite with all souls, all religions, they must be very careful. God wants all of His children to love one another, irrespective of race, creed or nation. What He will not permit is that Christians embrace pagans, within their church. When this happens, the heathen will wipe out all traces of Christianity. It is insulting to God, to take the Truth - the Word of God - and leave room for lies to contaminate It.
God's prophets warned humanity of the dangers of embracing paganism, as it leads to complete destruction. When this happens, the nations who allow this abomination into their churches will be wiped out, with little Mercy shown.
Do not accept tolerance for pagans to take over the churches of God. You must never forget the great Sacrifice made by God when He sent His only Son to bring you salvation. The day that you accept the practices of other churches, not of God, or when you show respect for pagans, is the day when you will turn your back on the Truth.
Keep your eyes open and pray that your churches will not force you to forgo your allegiance to Jesus Christ. Your beloved Mother
Mother of Salvation

God the Father: The antichrist is now ready to reveal himself
Wednesday, August 7th, 2013 @ 18:50

My dearest daughter, the world must prepare for the arrival of the greatest enemy of humanity since My children were placed on this Earth.
The antichrist is now ready to reveal himself and his plan is this. He will wait until wars rage everywhere. Then he will step in and create a false peace in the state of Israel by joining them with Palestine in an unlikely alliance. Everyone will lavish praise on him. He will not stop there, for he will move at a pace which will astonish many and he will negotiate peace agreements in many war-torn nations. Again, he will be praised and then be admired, with an extraordinary devotion by billions all over the world.
Then all will seem well. Very soon he will become involved with philanthropy and he will link up with the main world banks to create a new, powerful, financial institution. Many businesses and political leaders will become embroiled with his many plans. Soon a new monstrosity will be created, in the name of kick-starting the world's economy. This will be the new Babylon, the centre of all power, from which the world's elite and rich will trade. It will be seen to be the source of great news, so that people will benefit in every way from jobs, to the homes they live in and to the food they feed their families with.
All glory will surround the antichrist. Then he will, along with the false prophet, create a global partnership, which will be presented as the greatest humanitarian initiative. The world will applaud this new Babylon and everyone will clamour to try and gain even just a tiny foothold within its centre.
The new Babylon, all will be told, is to glorify the great one, to promote the environment, to embrace mother earth and to rid the world of poverty from the riches, which will pour from its vile mouth.
When this takes place, the Hand of My intervention will turn the world on its axis. I Am not going to stand by without warning My children of the consequences of embracing this abomination, created in the depths of Hell and inflicted upon humanity. My great signs will be given to show all those who embrace and accept this insult in My Holy Name.
I will shake the world and it will tilt. No man will be able to ignore My intervention. Then I will throw fire upon one third of the Earth. Soon, famine will be seen, but not by My Hand - it will be by the deliberate contamination of the Earth by the antichrist. As he and his cohorts inflict wickedness upon unsuspecting people in many nations, I will strike back.
While this suffering will be hard to endure, have no fear, children, for it will be short. My Love is great for all of you, but My Justice is swift and My punishment great.
You must not accept what is brought before you. When you see the man of peace, the antichrist, receive accolades and awards for his great works in war-torn countries, know that My Intervention is close.
You must remain in union with My Son, Jesus Christ, at all times and pray that the Sacraments will be made available to you by loyal priests and clergy during the times of trials which lie before you.
My Will, will be done.

Nothing can, nor will, stop the Final Covenant where My Son will Reign in Peace from being fulfilled. Your beloved Father
God the Most High

A soul cannot be made whole again until it recognises the Greatness of God
Friday, August 9th, 2013 @ 16:50

My dearly beloved daughter, people do not understand fully what it means to be in union with My Heart. I, Jesus Christ, came to free humanity from its slavery to sin. Sin was created when Lucifer believed that he was greater than God. Because of his wicked jealousy, he tempted man - God's first children, Adam and Eve - to turn away from Him.
My death gave all of God's children the Gift of salvation. Many people in the world, of all creeds, including those who do not believe in God or those who deny God and place false idols before Him, are all offered the Gift of salvation. Not all will accept this Gift. I come to each of you as a Saviour. I will come before each of you, to prove to you the Truth, before the final day. I will come to offer the Gift of Eternal Life even to those who have sinned gravely in the Eyes of God.
The Glory of God is your way forward and in order to receive this Gift all you have to do is to accept My Mercy. God is Almighty, Powerful and is Perfect in every way. He is much loved by all of the angels and saints in Heaven. He is much loved by many souls who are alive in the world today. All will witness His Great Glory in the New Heaven and the New Earth.
God does not need man. It is only because of His Love for man that He sends Me, His beloved Son, once again to bring them the Eternal Life, which He has promised. This is why He is Patient. This is why He turns a blind Eye to sin, in hope that His children will turn to Him and accept His Love.
Love is powerful when it is pure and comes from God. When the soul is pure, it will easily be drawn into the Love of God. Souls, who need to be cleansed, will accept the Love of God, if they accept the suffering which is needed to make them whole again. A soul cannot be made whole again until it recognises the Greatness of God and bows before Him in humble servitude.
The day when all of you will be shown the way to salvation is close. Every single sinner will be given the chance to reach out to God. Those who do will be lavished with My Mercy.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: What man could ever reject this new perfect existence
Friday, August 9th, 2013 @ 18:38

My child, every effort will be made by the evil one to encourage all souls, including those who are closest to the Heart of my Son, to reject and deny His Second Coming.
Just as the spirit of evil fought against me, the Mother of God, in the time leading up to the birth of Jesus, the same opposition will be witnessed as His Second Coming draws near.
Many people are blind to the Promise made by my Son, when He said that He would come again. Many, who do not accept that His Second Coming will happen soon, are unprepared because they cannot accept that it will take place in their lifetime.
Whereas, in the days soon after my Son's death on the Cross, His apostles thought that they would witness His Second Coming. This belief was also prevalent in the minds of Christians many hundreds of years later. But this is not the case today. Some believe that the Second Coming refers to an old part of Holy Scripture and that it is an event which is part of the future. They do not believe that the Second Coming has any relevance for them in today's modern world. Everything in the world today is based on materialism, modern human intelligence and the great wonders which spring from great advances in science.
Children, you must prepare. You must not be frightened. It is because you are very much loved by my Son that He comes back soon to bring you a great peace, a great freedom from sadness and despair - which are caused directly as a result of sin in the world.
The Second Coming of Christ is what humanity needs to survive. If Jesus did not come soon, as foretold, then the world would be destroyed and man would be forsaken. This Gift will bring you a new life, a new wonderful and glorious beginning in the New Paradise. It will be the greatest renewal of the Earth and with it will come Eternal Life. What man could ever reject this new perfect existence? No one, if given the full knowledge of this New Era of Peace, where Paradise will be restored, would turn their backs. Not one single sinner would want to be excluded, but sadly the minds of many will be blinded to the Truth. Instead, they will believe that peace will be theirs when they swallow the lies, which will soon be presented to them, in the mistaken belief that they come from God.
Pray, pray, children, that you are blessed with the Gift of vision, given to those of you who are worthy to be bestowed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit. Only those who accept the Hand of Mercy, by the Hand of God, will be taken into a life of eternity.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

Know that the pain of rejection will be exactly as I, and My apostles, had to suffer during My Time on Earth
Saturday, August 10th, 2013 @ 12:49

My dearly beloved daughter, not one man amongst you is so clean of soul that he can judge others in My Name. But know this, those of you who are loyal to Me and who follow My Teachings - you will have to bear much sorrow when you have to witness the greatest evil abomination, which faces the world.
In the name of social justice and social compassion, the false prophet will set out, what the world will believe to be, to evangelise and create a modern church. This church will be seen to reach out to all sinners and to embrace those sinners whose sins are not acceptable by Me.
You, My beloved followers, will be viewed as a heretic sect, because you will continue to proclaim the Truth. All attempts to remain true to Me will be attacked vigorously. You will be outcast and declared to be right-wing dissidents. Any attempt to retain the traditions of the Sacred Ceremonies will be ignored.
The power of those who will mislead My churches on Earth must not be underestimated, as millions of sacred servants will embrace the new false doctrine. They will, mistakenly, believe that this new doctrine is a form of evangelism. Their support, as willing servants of the abomination, will make it very difficult for those Christians who know the Truth. Their voices will be like whispers amidst the screams of those who will become slaves to lies, created in My Name.
Know that the pain of rejection will be exactly as I, and My apostles, had to suffer during My Time on Earth. The priests of the day, who claimed to love God, had no hesitation in silencing the voices of My disciples, who brought them the news of Who I was. This time, as I herald My Second Coming, My prophets and My disciples will find it harrowing when their voices will be dismissed and they will be accused of blasphemy.
While My followers expand and grow, they will be like paupers and they will climb the Hill of Calvary - naked, with nothing except their faith. While they will keep the Flame of My Light alive in My Church - My True Church - they will never deviate from the Truth and they will carry on their backs a heavy cross. This is the cross of salvation, for on their poor, weary backs they will carry the sins of those who deserted Me. Their lot will be hard. Because of their love for Me, they will suffer because of others, in order to save their sorry souls.
These souls do not deserve to be saved. They will only be saved because I choose to save them. They will have insulted Me, caused terrible suffering to My loyal followers and tormented My Remnant Army. Yet, I will save them because of the faith of those in My Remnant Army.
Those other people, who have sold their souls to the beast, know this. You may not believe in Hell, but I will reveal to you what suffering it will bring you. The day I will show you the levels of torture in Hell, it will terrorise you and many of you will scream for My Mercy. And I will save you, if you ask Me to forgive you. I will do this during the Day of the Great Warning. Those of you, who witness the burning fires of Hell, but who will not turn to Me - you will not survive The Warning and that moment when you reject Me will be your last.
All those, who remain loyal to Me and true to My Word - though you will suffer - the future ahead of you is one of great glory. Those who will not heed My Warning or listen to the Truth will be in great danger.
Those of you, who idolise the beast and who follow the false prophet into the new world religion, will be thrown in the burning fires of Hell, alive, with these two.
The Truth is bitter to taste, but when you accept it, it will bring you Eternal Life, where you will enjoy My Kingdom forever with your loved ones. Do not cut off the umbilical cord to Eternal Life, for you will suffer such terrible suffering and you will never be given a reprieve.
Your Jesus

Floods will be commonplace and you will know which parts of the world anger My Father the most
Monday, August 12th, 2013 @ 03:00

My dearly beloved daughter, My followers everywhere, including those who do not know about these Messages, will be drawn into My churches at this time seeking Me out. Because of My Gift to them of the Holy Spirit, they will be swept into My Refuge of the Heart. They will sense unease in the world and they will know that they need My help in order to remain firm to My Teachings.
Many will feel the changes in the air, as the enemies of God begin to make known their plan of hatred to deceive the world as their vile acts, to condone sin in all its guises, are made known. The world will be swept into a flood of anguish and many will be shocked by the attempts they will see everywhere to idolise sin in every form.
Sins of the flesh will be applauded. Vanity and an obsessive love of self will be witnessed all over the world. Self-obsession will, like never before, seem to be an essential trait. Those who do not seek out such pleasures will be discarded and made to feel like outsiders. The sins of the evil one will be glorified and as man finds himself sucked into this madness, the world will be shown the floods of wrath as My Father sweeps away many parts of many countries. Floods will be commonplace and you will know which parts of the world anger My Father the most, when the waters pour down in anger upon nations.
All your wicked nations will experience firsthand how sins of the flesh will be punished. My Father will stop the evil one from taking over the souls of those who are guilty of this sin, in order to prevent them from infesting others. They will be stopped. No more will they be allowed to continue with their infestation. This evil will be addressed and Divine Intervention will now be witnessed, everywhere, by the Hand of God.
Pray for Mercy those of you who may be caught up in these chastisements. I will protect those who turn to Me for protection. Your Jesus

They will soon use churches as places to trade in and profit from
Tuesday, August 13th, 2013 @ 15:00

My dearly beloved daughter, what misery will be felt by Catholics and Christians, all over the world, when they see how their churches and places of worship will be turned into places of entertainment.
Many events will be held in churches, which are meant to pay homage to Me, but which will insult My Name. They will soon use churches as places to trade in and profit from. All of these things are to come and for those who love Me, they will weep in great sorrow. How these poor souls will suffer, as they will have to battle such blasphemies. The heresies forced down their throats will mean that little respect will be shown to such souls during the many practices and ceremonies, which insult God. There will be singing, laughter, loud voices and the recital of tales, which have nothing to do with Me. Yet all of these vile acts will be committed in My Churches and before Me.
My daughter, heed now My Promise. I will go to the ends of the Earth to save every sinner. But, so infested will souls become, that no matter what I do for them, they will never accept My Mercy, even at the point of death, although they will know that Hell awaits them.
Therefore, you must accept that souls will be lost to Me, because their wickedness is so ingrained within their souls that no intervention will separate them from the beast.
What I must tell you is this. Do not allow those who are infested by the evil one to take you away from Me through their lies. When you accept lies, dictated to you by those who do not honour Me, you will weaken your faith - even if it is just one, in one aspect relating to My Teachings. If you give in to just one demand, designed to change your interpretation of what I have told you, this will mean that you will be allowing the evil one to tempt you, more forcibly, to turn away from Me.
Cover your ears with your hands when the blasphemies spill forth from the mouth of the beast. Accept nothing at all which will betray My Sacraments or My Teachings. Turn the other way and follow Me because, when all these things come to pass, there will be only one path you can walk. This is My Path - the Path of Truth. Only the whole truth is acceptable. Half a truth means that it becomes a lie.
Your Jesus

When you honour My Mother, you must visit her Shrines and pay homage to her there
Wednesday, August 14th, 2013 @ 15:15

My dearly beloved daughter, no living man can ever fully understand how cunning Satan is. In those he infests, know that they will never give you the impression of evil. On the contrary, they will be very appealing, humourous, authoritative and convincing when they reveal their sinful ways to you, so that you will be accepting of their deceit.
Those, within My Church, who pay homage to the evil one and who slavishly follow his instructions, will greatly confuse you by their holy demeanor.They will win many of you over to their ways, as it will seem to you that they truly honour Me and My beloved Mother. But know that every gesture and seemingly holy act will camouflage an insult before the altars, which are designated to honour My Name. You must know that when they honour the beast, they will present what will seem like holy acts before you, but they will be back to front. Their intentions will seem to be most holy and respectful, but do not be deceived.
When you honour My Mother, you must visit her Shrines and pay homage to her there. Those who love Me will go to her. They must never accept that My Mother can be commanded to the court of the enemies of My Church.
The other signs which the world will be asked to accept, which will seem to honour the Triune God, My Mother and all the saints, will seem to be good. But they will always be shown to you in a different way by the enemies of God. When the unexpected is presented, know that this is a great sign of the beast, who will fool the world into believing that he and his cohorts are saints.
Your Jesus

The First Judgement is close and I will cast the wicked aside
Thursday, August 15th, 2013 @ 21:57

My dearly beloved daughter, I Call on all of My disciples, who know the Truth, to show courage in these difficult times for humanity.
The time when wars will break out in many nations, at the same time, is very close. When you hear of all of these wars and witness the sheer cruelty of those oppressors, all joined at the hip, who cause these wars, you will know the time for My Second Coming is close.
More of you will recognise the Truth contained in the Book of John - the Revelation - as it is now being revealed to you. Do not fear, for all of these things must come to pass. Many, who do not accept these Messages make a grave mistake, for the Book of Truth is comprised simply of the detail and the secrets contained in the Book of Revelation. I, the Lamb of God, Am the only Authority - only I have permission from My Father - to open the Seals contained therein.
If you do not believe in the Book of Truth, then you do not believe in the Book of Revelation. Be warned. Those who reject the Book of Revelation forsake My Mercy. But the Truth will be shown to them during My Great Warning through Divine Intervention, for otherwise many would never know Me or understand the great Mercy I bring the world. You must never add to the Book of Revelation, try to interpret it or take anything out of it to suit your own desires, for you will suffer for this.
When you do these things you tamper with the Word of God. This Book was promised to you. God has sent His 7th messenger to reveal the Truth. Accept this with trust in Me or you will walk alone, in ignorance of the terrible deceit which will befall those who reject the Word of God.
Many, many changes will now take place in the world, which no man will fail to notice. Religions will become a nonsense, as millions will adopt a pagan faith, which they will be told is to honour God. Humility and love for the poor will be the reasons, you will be told, why the renewed and enlightened church will herald a new beginning. Like lambs to the slaughter, you will be led into the lake of fire. When you realise the terrible abomination, which you have been drawn into, it may be too late. When you pay homage to the beast, he will infest you and many will, in time, become slaves.
Great changes in the world's political and media systems will result in a great division. Those who are loyal to God in everything that was given to the world through Me, Jesus Christ, will live. Those who reject Me will have no life, for they will become incapable of accepting My Mercy. My Heart, although it will be cut in half because of this, will become hardened and My Justice will prevail.
The First Judgement is close and I will cast the wicked aside, as the New Heaven and New Earth will only welcome those who accepted My Mercy. Many will say: "God is Merciful. He would never show such cruelty." My answer is this. The Earth, as you know it, will be no more. Instead, a new renewed Earth will emerge - much larger, greater than before, where twelve nations will reside, side by side, in loving harmony. Only those who remain loyal to Me and those who do not know Me, but who do accept My Hand, when I prove to them the Truth at The Warning, will enter the gates. I will then shut them. No other man will enter then, for My Judgement will be cast. All sorrow will be forgotten and the wicked will be cast into Hell, where they will suffer an eternity. Man must never underestimate My Great Love, Mercy and Compassion. But he should also fear My Punishment for it will be final when the last trumpet sounds on the Great Day of the Lord.
And then, it will be over.

Your Jesus

They must retain the Holy Missals, the vestments, the Holy Bible and the Holy Crosses. These will all be replaced
Saturday, August 17th, 2013 @ 11:50

My dearly beloved daughter, many of those who are blessed with a strong faith and love for Me, Jesus Christ, are finally beginning to recognise My Voice, as I speak to the world through these Messages.
Those who spend their lives slavishly serving the serpent know also that it is I Who speaks. And so the battle to do My Holy Will, on the one hand, and the desire by the enemies of God to fight Me, begins.
Those who are planning to inflict suffering upon humanity, as part of a covenant with the beast, will be careful not to be seen to denounce these Messages publicly, as by doing so, they will give credence to them. Instead, they will spread hatred against Me in other ways, starting by destroying the faith of those within My Church. They will turn the hearts of those who love Me against their fellow Christians. They will embrace pagans, new age witches and worshipers of the beast, rather than Christians, who will object to the vile pagan rituals, which will be performed in Catholic Churches and soon other Christian churches.
These events are still to come. Please do not think that the current Holy Masses or Sacraments have changed yet, although they will change very soon. When they do, you must turn your back and defend Me.
Much change has been planned for the last few years by the evil of Masonry in My Church on Earth. Now their plans, already made known within the highest ranks in the churches, are about to be announced. They will be unveiled with the announcement that the Catholic Church is being modernized, so that it can become relevant in today's new, open- minded, liberal society. It will say, it will be putting the past behind and it will then say that its motto will be to embrace all creeds, to show that it is not narrow in attitude. This announcement will be celebrated all over the world and the media will cover this great news on its front pages, when before it viewed the Catholic Church with distaste.
The seed of Satan will be spent and the new ceremonies, where the format of the Holy Masses will be presented backwards, but all the correct phrases relating to My Passion will be substituted with nonsense - empty words - empty vessels - empty tabernacles. All My Crosses will be replaced with the secret symbols of the occult.
This is the desolation spoken of to the prophet Daniel. This is the end of My Holy Eucharist and the end of the Mass, as you know it, in many places. But My beloved loyal servants will prepare now, the production of the Holy Hosts. They must retain the Holy Missals, the vestments, the Holy Bible and the Holy Crosses. These will all be replaced.
You must gather soon and plan, for you will not be allowed to say Mass according to My Will.

I will guide you, My sacred servants, when the time comes. To those Christians who believe that this abomination will only be seen in the Catholic Church, then know that it will affect all Christian churches, until they banish all mentions of, or signs of, Me. In time, you will be severely punished for mentioning My Name.
You will be shocked at how quickly the seemingly innocent, renewed, but contaminated, Church will descend into a wicked cult. They will go to extraordinary lengths to punish those who will defy their manmade, pagan, new world religion.
Christians and Jews will be the main target of hatred and they will be persecuted because of their religion.

Instead of being fearful, I Call you to be prepared to fight for My Name. Never forget how much I Am still hated. Know when you follow Me, in these times which lie ahead, your cross will be much heavier than those who came before you.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: They will need to find places of refuge so that they can provide daily Masses and the Holy Eucharist
Saturday, August 17th, 2013 @ 16:45

O my dear children, how much my Heart grieves for the suffering, which faces priests within the Catholic Church, shortly.
So many precious servants of my Son, whose only desire is to serve God and bring souls on the right path to salvation, are going to be faced with trials of such magnitude that many will fall away in fear. Many will be blind to the Truth and will accept great changes in the Church and will welcome these, in the mistaken belief that they are for the good of all. Those who will recognise the deceit, which will be presented to Catholics, will run. So fearful of their fate, they will leave the Church, for they will be too weak to stand up against such wickedness.
Those priests who will refuse to accept the false doctrine will be accused of heresy and many will be publicly rebuked, for failing to obey those to whom they answer. Many will be excommunicated. Others will be martyred. Then there will be those who will lead the Church - the Church given to the world by my Son - in secret.
They will need to find places of refuge, so that they can provide daily Masses and the Holy Eucharist. They will be guided by the Holy Spirit and they will be followed by my Son's Remnant Army, who will remain fiercely loyal to His Teachings and Sacraments up to the final day.
You must understand that if you are in any doubt about the validity of this warning, that I, the beloved Mother of Christ, will be used to hide the true intent of those forces, who have entered my Son's Church on Earth. I will be used as a figurehead of the Church to distract people from the true intentions of this wicked group. In order to convince God's children that they remain loyal to the true Word of God and the traditions of the Catholic Church, they will create ceremonies, which they will say honour
me. They will use the prophecies of Fatima to desecrate my image, by presenting a great deceit to the world. They will use me in order to defile my Son's Church and everything they will do will be backwards, in accordance with the demands of the evil one.
By giving the impression that they honour the Mother of God, many Catholics will be led into a false sense of security. This will mean that any doubts, which they would otherwise have, when they witness the strange new amendments to the Mass and Sacraments, will be instantly forgotten. How this brings me great sorrow. My image will be deliberately used to insult my Son.
Satan despises me. He also fears me. To hurt my Son, he will, through those souls he influences, go to great lengths to defile my image through many secret rituals and black masses. My statue will be adorned with satanic symbols and I will be desecrated in many places by Masonic groups who have gained control.
Pray, pray, pray, children, every day, for the strength to confront this wickedness with courage. Do not fear it. Accept that Satan's army is now controlling many nations, in every part of the world. When you accept this, you can then be given the strength and determination you need. When you ask for these graces, through the Crusade Prayers, you can and will help to mitigate this wickedness.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

They will be asked to pledge their allegiance, through a new oath, to remain faithful to the Church
Sunday, August 18th, 2013 @ 17:45

My dearly beloved daughter, the plan by the false prophet to deceive the world's clergy has begun.

Under the guise of a renewal and regeneration of the Catholic Church, all the clergy, within this Church, will be sent on retreats to encourage them to accept the new apostolate. These will become widespread and many will be told that the objective is to unite everyone in the world, in the name of justice. This new mission will, they will be told, embrace the world's poor and strive to bring about unity. They will be asked to pledge their allegiance, through a new oath, to remain faithful to the Church. They will not be asked to place their faith in Me or My Holy Word. Instead, they will swear allegiance to the new self-proclaimed leaders who have taken over the Chair of Peter.
Make no mistake that those who have been bestowed with the Gift of Holy Orders will be asked to participate in a falsity, where I, Jesus Christ, will not be at the forefront, though it will appear to be the case. Money will be a driving force and a new financial organization will be set up to control the seeking of funds to ensure that the world's poor will benefit.
When you amend your Holy Orders, in any way, and then pledge your life to someone who breaks all ties with Me, you will no longer be fit to serve Me. Everything will be seen to be made simple in the Eyes of God. The plan will be to convince those sacred servants of Mine to take part, willingly, in the abomination, which will link society and a secular world with the Church, which was set up by Me, Jesus Christ.
This is how I will be insulted. Every effort to embrace secularism will be applauded by non-believers and this will be seen to be a good thing, for the new, so-called modern society of today.
It will soon seem strange to Christians when they see members of the secular world embrace the Catholic Church, so enthusiastically. But many will brush off their doubts and dismiss their concerns, as they will fall for the great deceit. At the kernel of this plan to revolutionize the Church lies a hatred for Me and everything that I gave My Church. You must question everything in the days ahead. Demand answers when they change My Teachings and twist them to suit pagans. No disciple, appointed by Me, would ever be given the authority to do this, for it amounts to blasphemy.
Woe to those who allow My Holy Word to be tampered with and allow room to be set aside to show respect for those who deny Me.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: My children everywhere - you must listen to me, your beloved Mother, at this time of sorrow
Monday, August 19th, 2013 @ 18:28

My children everywhere - you must listen to me, your beloved Mother, at this time of sorrow. I call especially on those of you who have a great devotion to me, the Mother of God, as I comfort you at this time of great apostasy. You must accept this Intervention from Heaven with good grace and be thankful that because of the great Love of my beloved Father, that you have been given this great Gift.
When you believe that the grave wave of paganism, which will soon engulf my Son's Church, all over the world, is beyond your endurance, then you must ask for my intercession. Whatever happens, when you remain faithful to my Son, although every attempt will be made to distract you, all will be well. Never feel that it is hopeless, for the great Glory of my Son and the Will of God will soon be revealed.
No matter how many in the Church are led into grave error, the Word of God will spread like wildfire. The two witnesses to the Word of God - the true Christian Church and the House of Israel will stand the test of time. Fire will pour from their mouths in the form of the Holy Spirit.
In time, after the abomination of desolation has been revealed, those loyal to the Truth will rise and theirs will be the Kingdom of Christ. Lies will always be found out, though in the beginning, those of you who have been filled with the Gift of the Holy Spirit will suffer so much when you witness the terrible desecration in my Son's Churches. The Truth will be seen and all of those who were misled in the beginning will, eventually, understand the evil, which will have been laid down before you.
You must only trust in my Son during this torturous journey, where you will be treated like a criminal for insisting on staying true to the Word of God. Please remember my Son's Own journey to Calvary. Accept this cross, with love and dignity, as you are greatly pleasing to my Son when you carry His burden. Through your sacrifice and suffering, He will redeem the most unworthy of souls and then He will be able to unite all of God's children.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

I will ensure that millions more hear My Words
Tuesday, August 20th, 2013 @ 19:20

My dearly beloved daughter, My Love and My Compassion for all sinners has meant that I grant great Mercy on billions of souls. As of today, I will open their eyes to My Messages for humanity. I will ensure that millions more hear My Words, so that I can take many more lost souls into the New Paradise. All such souls, who would never accept these Messages because of their stubbornness, will now see them, for what they are - an Act of Mercy on My part, so that I can salvage their souls.
Priests, who had denounced My Messages and declared them to be the words of the devil will by then realise the terrible mistake they made, by denying souls the opportunity of listening to My Heavenly Voice.
Non-believers, who have struggled to find peace, will now be drawn to My Messages and soon they will seek comfort from Me. I Am waiting for them and as soon as they walk towards Me, I will fill them with a longing for My Love so that they will be powerless to ignore Me.
Believers in God the Almighty Father, who do not accept Me, His beloved Son, will feel a stirring within their souls. They will cry out for the Truth as they witness the ways in which the world will have changed beyond recognition.
Then, those who love Me and who remain staunch in their faith, but who fail to recognise Me when I Call out to their souls, will be overcome by the final realization, when My Divine Presence will be made known to them. I will rejoice when these, My followers, allow Me to guide them properly on the final journey.
I give the world these Gifts because I love everyone. Await this Gift with love and thanksgiving. Your Jesus

My Second Coming cannot take place until the contamination of sin has been eradicated
Wednesday, August 21st, 2013 @ 18:05

My dearly beloved daughter, the renewal and purification of the Earth has now commenced as My Time draws near. My Second Coming cannot take place until the contamination of sin has been eradicated, through the cleansing needed on this Earth.
As the Earth will be purified, souls of every creed will be plunged into a renewal of the spirit and many will endure a terrible spiritual battle. They will not understand what they are enduring, but I will allow this because of My Mercy. In order to be fit to stand before Me and to be given Eternal Life in the New Paradise, souls must first be purified. This purification will take place on Earth, for those who will live through the persecution of the antichrist, as well as for those who will live through the transition into the New Paradise. The Earth will, at the same time, commence its own renewal and all evil will be weeded out, stage by stage.
Be thankful that My Father has not lost His Patience and that He does not punish His children, according to the severity of their sins. Be thankful also that He does not just turn His Back now and simply take those souls who truly love Him away from this Earth, which by its iniquity, disgusts Him.
My Father perseveres because His children are His Creation and He will not allow them to be taken by Satan. So jealous was Lucifer, that when My Father created man in His Own Likeness, he vowed to fight to the last day in order to turn man against his Creator.
My Father will intervene, out of Love, in order to render powerless the strength of Satan. Every attempt, of Satan's version of the Triune God, comprising of the false prophet, the antichrist and the spirit of evil, will be thwarted. This battle will be ugly, unfair to many souls, who will be too weak to wrestle free from the grip of evil, but it will be won by Almighty God.
You must, all of you, turn to My Father and beg Him to salvage your souls and to protect you from following the beast on the road to perdition.
Your Jesus

I must warn the world of the large number of false prophets, who at this time try to drown out My Voice
Thursday, August 22nd, 2013 @ 23:05

My dearly beloved daughter, I must warn the world of the large number of false prophets, who at this time try to drown out My Voice.
I have sent a number of prophets, all with different missions, to prepare God's children. These Messages, regarding the end times, are the only authentic Messages of their kind, at this exact time, for I would never confuse God's children.
These Messages must never be compared to others, which are being spread everywhere, right now, in order to contradict My Holy Word. There can only be one Book of Truth - only I, Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, can reveal the contents. Those of you who believe in Me can be so easily fooled. You must know that messages, which contradict these and where it is claimed that they come from God, that this is impossible.
Do you trust Me only a little? Or do you embrace Me as I desire you to, with a full and open heart? I Call out to you with love and concern. I do not try to appeal to your intelligence. I Call to you through your heart and I draw your soul to Me. When you feel My Presence in these Messages, then there is no need to seek endorsement or approval from anyone.
I Am as I Am. I stand before you, as it was meant to be, now. My Father would never permit Me to reveal the content of the Book of Revelation to anyone else but the seventh messenger, for this day has arrived.
Many authentic visionaries have given the world the Word of God in the past and suffered terribly for this. Many still receive consolation from Me and I will continue to communicate to them, for I need their suffering and prayers. They are My chosen souls and each has a role to play in saving other souls.
This Mission is the last. I instruct you to heed My Word, now, in the present. Only My Word, given to you through these Messages, will guide you through the persecution. With them, I bring you great Graces. You must never insult Me, by contaminating them, when you challenge My Word, when you compare My Messages with the fiction produced by false prophets.
You do not need anyone to guide you towards My Great Mercy. You must focus only on these Messages and remain loyal to My Teachings of old, now, for they are your saving grace.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: The antichrist, upon his announcement, will declare that he is a devout Christian
Friday, August 23rd, 2013 @ 14:09

My child, how Christians will suffer as the disease of sin engulfs the world everywhere in many guises.

There is an organized attempt being made to wipe out Christianity and this takes many forms. You will know that when Christians are denied the right to publicly declare their allegiance to God, that every other creed, not of God, will be permitted to do so.
These other creeds will be given great support when they plead for justice, in the name of their rights as citizens. What this will do is to spread further the sins which are abhorrent to my Father.
People will be forced to accept sin in their countries and it will become an offense for Christians to object to these laws. Christians will be viewed as being uncharitable, right wing and out of touch with the human rights of others. Every trait, desirable in souls, as laid down by my Father, will be used as a front in their efforts to justify such wickedness in your nations.
When disease of the flesh grips a community, it kills many. But, after a time of great sorrow and many deaths, the remaining community becomes immune to the disease. Sin will cause disease of the flesh in many nations, as the judgements of the Seals are declared by the Saviour of humanity and poured down by the angels of the Lord. Many will be killed in atonement for the wickedness of man. This purification will continue until there will remain only those who are immune to death because of their love for God.
Christians will suffer greatly in a number of ways. Their faith will be taken away from them and in its place an abomination will be witnessed. Their pain, which has already begun, is the same as that experienced by my Son, at this time. Then, they will have to witness an astonishing sight, as the antichrist, upon his announcement, will declare that he is a devout Christian. He will use many extracts from the Bible in his speeches to the world. Weary Christians, who suffered up to this, will suddenly be relieved. At last, they will think, here is a man sent from Heaven in answer to their prayers. Out of his mouth will spill many sweet and comforting words and he will appear to be a godsend, in that he will be seen to amend the wrongs against Christians. He will carefully construct how he is perceived by Christians and especially Roman Catholics, for these will be his main target.
All will admire the antichrist and his so-called christian acts, gestures and his perceived love of Holy Scripture will make him instantly acceptable by many. He will draw all nations together and set about holding ceremonies for other religions and, in particular, pagan organizations, so that they can work together to bring about world peace. He will succeed in uniting countries, which had been enemies up till then. Silence will be heard in war torn countries and his image will appear everywhere. His final, great achievement will be when he brings all those nations he unites, into the domain of the Catholic Church and all other Christian denominations. This unification will form the new, one world religion. From that day forth, Hell will break loose on Earth and the influence of demons will be at its greatest level since before the great flood. People will be seen to adore God in the new, one world order church and appear to be devout in every way. Then outside of the churches they will indulge in sin openly, for no sin will shame them. Under the hypnotic direction of the false trinity - the trinity created by Satan - they will crave every kind of sin as a means to sustain their newfound appetite.
This wickedness will include sins of the flesh, where nakedness will be acceptable, as man will become involved in obscene sins of the flesh in public places. Murders will be common and committed by many, including children.
Satanic worship and black masses will take place in many Catholic Churches. Abortion will be seen as a solution for every kind of problem and will be permitted right up to the day of birth.
It will soon become a criminal offence to show any kind of allegiance to Jesus Christ. If you are seen with a true Cross you will find that you have committed an offense, because you will be breaking the law. The law in your lands will become a dual law - where politics and religion will be entwined in the new world order.
This persecution will mean that many, unknowingly, will adore the beast and become infested. So infested will they become that they will betray brother, sister, mother and father, to the authorities, if they should remain loyal to Christianity. Your only hope, children, is prayer to sustain you through this period.
I urge you to keep all holy objects, rosary beads, blessed candles, holy water, a copy of the Bible and the holy daily Missal along with the Crusade of Prayer book. You must keep the Seal of the Living God in your home and on you if possible. My Medal of Salvation will convert those who wear it and they will be shown Mercy by my Son. I now request you, child, to have the Medal of Salvation produced now and a Scapular of the Seal of the Living God made.
This Message is a warning from Heaven of things to come. You must listen to me, the Mother of Salvation, as I must guide you to the Truth, so that you will remain truly faithful to my Son at all times.
Go in peace, children, and be calm as this trial will, because of the Mercy of God, be short. Trust in me, your Mother, as I will be with you always during your trials. You will never be alone.
Your Mother

Mother of Salvation

God the Father: Children we are but just a short time away from the Great Day
Friday, August 23rd, 2013 @ 15:00

My dearest daughter, while the world strives to make sense out of the despair they witness, know that all of these turmoils must take place, before I bring all those who love Me into My Place of Refuge.
You will soon know Who I Am, children. Those of you who are unsure of Me will see the Truth at last and this will bring you great peace. The evil in the world increases now and the deceit descends. You must be strong, I plead with you, as I await now the day when the renewal will begin and all of My children will find solace on the Day, when My beloved Son declares Himself.
What you are witnessing is a battle between My Heavenly Hierarchy and Satan and all his demons. It is frightening and very upsetting for many of you, but know that I will intervene to ease your pain. Know that you are Mine and that I will bring peace to the world, when I have rid it of infestation.
Children, we are but just a short time away from the Great Day and while much still has to take place, where the Sacred Name of My Son will be torn apart, it will be swift. You must look now to the future, as it is a glittering jewel of such magnitude that on the Day when you enter the New Era of Peace, you will have forgotten the persecution inflicted upon the world by the evil one. You must do as My Son instructs you. You must remain calm as the Seals are revealed to you, which are all for your own good and those whose souls I ask you to plead for My Mercy.
If you stay true to My Commandments and live your lives in union with My Son, you will be half way there. If you remain firm to the Sacraments and refuse to participate in pagan rituals, which honour the beast, then you will find much favour with Me.
Go and remember that I Am the Almighty One and that all Power is Mine. Soon, I will destroy the wicked and unveil My New Paradise to you. Be patient. Trust in Me.Follow My Son and accept the Gifts, which He and His beloved Mother, the Immaculate Virgin Mary, bring you, in the form of the Crusade Prayers and the Medal of Salvation.
Finally accept My Seal as one of the greatest Gifts I have given humanity since I gave them Life. I give Life again with My Special Graces when you hold close to you, the Seal of the Living God. All those with the Seal are granted a place in the New Paradise.
I love you, children, but I Am your Father and I must allow these trials, as they will help Me to weed out those who will never deviate from the side of the beast. The time I spend trying to win over their hearts creates a terrible and hateful battle, with millions of fallen angels and demons, even though it be just one soul.
Remain comforted in the knowledge that I bless all of you, who are pure and humble of heart. I love all of you, so you must never give up when all seems hopeless, for My Power means that the destruction of evil is under My Control. You must place all your trust in Me, especially at this time, when you feel that My Justice is harsh.
Your beloved Father God the Most High

This fire will also be cast down upon the enemies of the Earth and those who persecute these Two Witnesses
Saturday, August 24th, 2013 @ 23:15

My dearly beloved daughter, you and all those who have been blessed with the Truth, must know that the wrath of Satan is increasing against this Mission. His daring interference has meant that he has now manifested physically before you, for the third time. He groans in pain, but cannot withstand My Light, which is present within you. You must gain the strength you need, through the recital of the Holy Rosary, in order to prevent him from attacking you. Oh, if souls could witness what I permit you to endure for the sake of this Mission, they would faint with shock.
Those who insult Me during My preparation to save souls, will be cast aside as this battle intensifies, before the antichrist is presented to the world. When you become obedient and question nothing, which I demand of you, I can save more of you and pluck you from the grip of deceit, which will be planted within your minds by the evil one.
Don't you trust Me to protect you? Don't you know that when you accept the Graces I give, to help you withstand the pain of rejection, that they are meaningless if the receiving soul has reservations or doubts? I cannot fill you with the strength, the courage and the Gift of the Holy Spirit, if you cower and hide. You must be open to My Call, My Love, My Gifts.
The Seals contained within the Book of Revelation have already opened. Now that they have opened, fire will fight fire. As the fire of hatred erupts, when the beast prepares himself, fire will be poured over the Earth by My Father. This war will not just be a spiritual one. The Earth will be rocked, split and the fire will burn it, as My Father inflicts punishments, so that He can delay the actions of the evil group.
My Father's Power is to be feared by those who follow, blindly, the lies, which are inflicted upon the world by the evil one. He will retaliate for every wicked act carried out by any of you - knowingly or unknowingly - when you pay homage to the enemy of God. The Power given to My Two Witnesses - the Christian Church and the House of Israel - will mean that fire will pour from their mouths, as they spread the Flames of the Holy Spirit. This fire will also be cast down upon the enemies of the Earth and those who persecute these Two Witnesses. Do not underestimate the battle for souls, for it will be a terrifying one for those who deny the Word of God. Those who uphold it, will be protected, so that their proclamation of the Truth can be given to those who have no idea what has befallen humanity.
This is why you must accept My Graces, to give you the strength you need to fight in My Army, so that I can bring an end to the wickedness.
Your Jesus

God the Father: Fear you, those who stand up and curse My Son
Sunday, August 25th, 2013 @ 18:00

My dearest daughter, I Am to bequeath a great Gift upon the world because of this My Most Holy Mission. I Am going to save 200 million souls, without hesitation, irrespective of how much they offend Me, and I will do this next week because of the suffering associated with this Mission.
My Act of Intervention is because of your request, My daughter, and I will continue to grant great Gifts as this Mission continues. Those who love Me will endure, with patience, the persecution they face and will continue to endure, because this is My Desire.
Those who persecute you, My dear little one, because you continue to proclaim the Holy Word of My Son, must know this. If you demonise My Son, I will punish you. If you demonise His Most Holy Word and then say that you are a child of God, I will cast you into the wilderness. Nothing will prevent My prophet from completing this Mission. Nothing. Try as you will, you will fail, for you will be fighting a war which you will never win. My Almighty Power cannot be touched, tampered with or challenged. Challenge My Divine Intervention to save the world and you will feel My Wrath. You will be destroyed. Fear you, those who stand up and curse My Son. Your pride and your disobedience will be your downfall. I have warned, through the prophets of old, the consequences of ignoring My Voice.
I now move forward to finalise the beginning of the final onslaught upon humanity. I have permitted the final battle to take place. I have given the evil one the last chance to infest those who are drawn to him. I do this so that by the Mercy of My Son, souls will defy the beast. They will do this because of their loyalty to My Son. Those, who do not know Me or My Son, will be given great Graces so that they will accept salvation. All salvation is by the Power of My Mercy.Only those stubborn hardened hearts will remain loyal to the beast. I will pull all the others towards Me. I will ensure that every chance will be given to every soul, so that they can redeem themselves, before My Son, before the final day.
This Final Mission has been created in Heaven since the beginning. All the angels and saints work in union to bring all of My children back to Me, their beloved Father. The final journey is now. All who walk with My Son, stay close to Him at this time. You will not be able to endure this painful journey unless you listen to what He tells you. Do not be swayed by those who will work day and night to force you to turn your back. If you allow this to happen you will find it very difficult to pick yourself up again.
You are nothing without My Son. You are nothing without Me. Until you surrender all and follow the Truth, you will never find it.

Attempt to prevent the Truth from being given to the world by Me, your Creator and I will strike you down and your weeping will be of no consolation. I will cast the proud and arrogant, who believe that they know more than Me, into the wilderness. You will not succeed when you defy My Word and deny My Presence when I try to save you.
Ungrateful man, you have little time left. By listening to Me, you can come to Me, but you can only do this when you crawl on your face and fall in humility before My Son. My Mission has reached a very dangerous phase as every effort will be made by those who are My enemies to tear it apart. This may seem to happen, but know that those enemies of Mine have very little time and soon, when My Patience has been expended, they will be no more, for they will never see My Face.
Your Father

God the Most High

The Pharisees scourged and murdered many before they finally crucified Me
Monday, August 26th, 2013 @ 20:20

My dearly beloved daughter, before I was crucified, many hateful lies were created about Me by My enemies. There were gatherings held by the Pharisees, many times, to decide what to do about Me. They would not accept, for one minute, that I had been sent by God to save humanity. How they hated Me. How they screamed and tormented those disciples of Mine, who were caught by them.
The Pharisees scourged and murdered many before they finally crucified Me. Their savagery and their wickedness were against God's Teaching and the Most Holy Bible. This did not deter them, as they hunted Me down. They would preach the Word of God and then they would defy the Word of God - all at the same time. Not only did they condemn Me, but they declared that God would never send a Messiah of this type. They looked down on humble and poor people and those they considered to be theologically ignorant. Their hatred of Me frightened many poor souls, who attended the temples. Those who asked them why they, the Pharisees, condemned Me, were themselves condemned, for daring to question their reasons for rejecting Me.
There were many false prophets preaching, while I walked the Earth and I was considered to be insane and not to be tolerated. Many of these false prophets quoted from the Book of Genesis and made ridiculous claims, which were offensive to God, yet they were tolerated and given little attention.
Although the miracles, which I performed, were witnessed, they would still not open their eyes to the Truth, for they did not want to see. The priests of the day made many public speeches, which condemned Me as being the son of Satan and warned those who were seen to associate with Me that they would be expelled from the temples. They rejected Me because they could not accept My humble origins and because I was not educated to their high expectations. Therefore, they concluded, I could not possibly be the Messiah. They thought that the Messiah would come from within their own ranks. And so, they detested everything about Me. They felt threatened by My Words, which despite their rejection of Me, touched them in some way, which they did not understand.
They were not prepared for My First Coming. They certainly are not prepared for My Second Coming, today. Anyone who dares to say that they are a prophet, sent to warn God's children of the Second Coming, will be tolerated, once they do not reveal the Truth. But when a true prophet reveals himself and speaks the Word of God, he or she will be hated and publicly condemned. When you see outright condemnation, based on ignorance of the Promises made by Me, to come again, and when the hatred is so vicious that the perpetrators break the Word of God, you will know then that it is Me they hate. Only I can attract such hatred amongst sinners. Only My Voice stirs up such opposition.
Were I to walk the Earth, at this time, they would crucify Me again. Those who claim to love Me and who lead My disciples in the Christian Church would be, sadly, the first to drive the first nail into My Flesh.
Remember, none of you is worthy to place yourself before Me. None of you has the authority to publicly condemn My Word, when you do not know Me. You, who condemn Me, as I try to fulfill My Father's Final Covenant, have no shame. Your pride disgusts Me. You have condemned your own souls, in My Eyes. You have learned nothing about Me. You do not believe in Holy Scripture because you deny that My Second Coming will take place.
You will be asked to count the souls you have lost Me on the final day. On that day, as you scream for My Mercy, you will be unable to look Me in the Eye.
Your Jesus

For every evil act of war and terror, God will cast them out and strike them stone dead
Tuesday, August 27th, 2013 @ 23:45

My dearly beloved daughter, the world is about to endure terrible wars and hatred will spread and infect many
nations. Unrest and division will be present in most countries and people will know then that times have changed beyond belief.

A deep unsettling anxiety will be felt and people will find it difficult to know whom to trust. This is how Satan infests God's children, as he pits one against the other. Only those who believe in the True God will find comfort, for they will know that their faith and love for Me will keep them strong.
You must pray hard, so that the deceit that has fallen, which is the cause of many wars, will be exposed for what it is - an attempt to cause deep division and hatred in order to control. My Father will punish the oppressors, as they cause havoc and pain upon the innocents. They may kill and maim many, but they will be struck down by My Father, for their wickedness.
Those who believe that they can create war and fool the world will not get much time to boast of their wicked activities. Their fate is sealed. Intervention by the Hand of God will be seen in every part of the world. For every evil act of war and terror, God will cast them out and strike them stone dead.
War created by the hand of man destroys life of the flesh. Punishment by My Father stops the life of the soul from being given the Gift of salvation.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: On the last day when the dawn breaks, a loud sound of the trumpet will be heard all over the world
Wednesday, August 28th, 2013 @ 20:00

My children, let me embrace you as you continue to endure the insults you witness against My Son.

When you listen to these Holy Messages and learn to understand them, then many of you will forge ahead, with great courage, to warn the world of the times ahead, in order that God can prepare His children for the New Paradise.
What you must understand is that you will be hated for your Work for my Son. You will not be accepted by many and you will endure pain and humiliation as a result. For every step you take, you will face an obstacle because you walk in the Footsteps of my Son.
None of you will find this easy, until you accept, with a calm resignation, that this is to be expected. Even those who follow my Son, but who will not accept these Messages, will fight you and persecute you, in His Name. They do not see that by behaving with such hatred that they insult my Son.
You must accept that when my Son makes Himself known, that His Words will be attacked and bring about great division. When you understand why you are facing such attacks and why you are being punished for speaking to the world on His behalf, you will then find this Work easier.
This persecution will continue, sadly, until the Day of His Second Coming. Please, for His Sake, accept these trials out of love for Him and you will give great glory to God because of this suffering. Not any part of this suffering is wasted, because when accepted with love for Jesus, it defeats the evil one, as it weakens his plan to destroy humanity.
Forgive those poor souls who fight this Mission. Ignore the cruelty you have to endure in my Son's Name. Accept that when they hate you, because of your love for my Son, that you are very much favoured by God.
Forgive those sacred servants, who prevent you from speaking of the Book of Truth. They do not understand the magnitude of God's Plan to prepare mankind for the New Beginning, for they, themselves, are not prepared. Many of them only do what they do because of their love for my Son. They mean no harm. They simply do not see, because they cannot see.
Pray, pray, pray that I, your Mother, will be given the Power to help you to endure this journey, without giving up, until the last day is close. On that Day, when the dawn breaks, a loud sound of the trumpet will be heard all over the world. It will sound just as you would expect it to sound and it will be followed by the singing of the choir of angels. This will be heard in every single country, city, town, village - everywhere. Then, you, my child, as the seventh angel, will declare that my Son has come. The skies will turn gold and soon after, a Miracle will be seen by every man, woman and child - by every sinner. My Son will make Himself known on the clouds just as He went. Then down will come, from the Heavens, the New Jerusalem - the New Beginning, for all those who accepted the Mercy of God.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

You must pray for their souls, as they have sold them
Thursday, August 29th, 2013 @ 23:53

My dearly beloved daughter, those of you who pray My Crusade Prayers diligently, know that I bring relief to the world from the snares of the devil.
The old serpent falls and stumbles losing much power when you strive to say My Crusade Prayers, daily. And while the times of great trials continue, your prayers will create many setbacks in the plans created by Masonic powers in the world, which are designed to create havoc in order to control the weak and vulnerable. Just one Crusade Prayer, said from the heart, is enough for Me to destroy the power of arrogant political leaders, who do not have a conscience.
Egoism is a curse and a liability to mankind's ability to live in harmony and peace. The obsession with personal ambition brings nothing but division, as man strives to dominate those he feels he needs to, in order to gain much.
Those of you who follow, blindly, the orders of those in positions of power, who direct you into committing acts, which you know are abhorrent in the Eyes of God, then you, too, will be found as guilty as those who tempt you to carry out such wickedness. The men and women, whose power over others has been created because of corrupt acts and other means, will have much work to do, if they wish to enjoy My Glorious Kingdom.
I will fell the egotists and proud amongst you. I will throw you onto the ground, until you become as humble as those you trample upon.
I will cut out the hearts of those hardened and stubborn souls who care nothing for anyone's needs, except their own. They will be taught that if they cannot love, then they shall not have it. Instead of love, they seek only idolization. These poor souls who have been elevated before you in the world, in every form, are victims of Satan.Instead of applauding their boastfulness and accepting their insatiable need for public adoration, you must pray for their souls as many have sold them.
Many souls in positions of influence over others, including those in politics, the world of music, the media, the entertainment business and those in high finance, are to be held in your hearts, as many have become slaves to themselves and their needs, which serve only their own lusts and desires. They infest the innocent, who emulate them and copy their lifestyles, which have separated them from God.
I, Jesus, condemn the world of false idols created by those who want nothing but power, wealth and the ability to influence others.

The spread of atheism has been caused by man's pride in his own ability. It has been caused by man's belief that mortal man, because of the Gift of human intelligence, has all the answers to the true meaning of your life on Earth.
Young souls have been lost to Me because they idolize false idols in the form of worldly goods, fashion, music and the world of entertainment. It isn't that they must not enjoy life - because this brings Me happiness - it is their lack of love for Me and their own bodies which grieve Me. They were born pure and perfect. Their bodies are a Gift from Heaven. They desecrate their bodies and have no shame in performing obscene acts in order to draw innocent souls towards them. Many of those with such power have sold their souls for their diabolically inspired gifts. The only reason they were given these gifts was to provide pleasure to the world, as a talent given to them by God. But, Satan tempted many and promised them, in return for their souls, a glorious and glittering life of wealth, adulation, fame and pleasure. When they received these gifts, they then used them to infest other souls. And so, it continues, until millions of other souls become slaves to Satan. Many souls who follow false idols become drawn to drug addiction. They have no shame, no modesty nor real love for each other, as each tries to vie for the greatest attention.
So much time is spent in the battle for self-glory, which is caused by an obsessive love of themselves, that God plays no role at all in their lives. Many of them reject God openly through the desecration of the Holy Crucifix - so little shame do they
have. Know that they would suffer a terrible fate, were I not to intervene. These are just one group of lost souls, which I will garner and then provide them with the Gift of salvation, because of your prayers My beloved followers. I will take them through this special prayer, into My Refuge.
Crusade Prayer (117) For those who have sold their souls

Dearest Jesus, I consecrate the souls of (list them here) and all those who swapped their souls for the price of fame. Rid them of their infestation. Turn them away from the threat of the Illuminati, who devour them.
Give them the courage to walk away from this wicked bondage without fear. Take them into Your Arms of Mercy and nurture them back to a State of Grace, so they are fit to stand before You.
By Your Divinity, help me through this prayer, for Satan's adopted souls, to prise them away from Masonry. Free them from the shackles which bind them and which result in a terrible torture in the chambers of Hell.

Help them, through the suffering of chosen souls, through my prayers and through Your Mercy, to be in the front line, ready to enter the Gates of the New Era of Peace - the New Paradise. I beg You to release them from captivity. Amen.
Your Jesus

Great rejoicing will take place everywhere. This will last 100 days
Friday, August 30th, 2013 @ 20:24

My dearly beloved daughter, please ensure that every nation hears My Prophecies, so that they can prepare themselves for the wonderful, renewed Earth - the New Paradise. Every child of God is entitled to his or her inheritance and so, just as if they were preparing for a great wedding, they must begin to plan for this Great Day.
I Call out to Jews, Muslims and Christians, as well as every other creed, to listen to Me now. Not one of you will be untouched by the wickedness of the antichrist. But if you prepare now, you will become immune to the suffering which he will inflict on the world, by taking the Seal of the Living God and keeping it in your homes.
When the Word of God, the True Word, is made known to you, you must stop and listen, for it will lead you to the Gates of the New Heaven and the New Earth. This New Paradise is awaiting and will become home to billions of souls, including those who await in the state of Purgatory and in Heaven. I will unite all those whose hearts are open to the Command of God, who will feel the Love of My Mercy.
Please do not fear this Day, as it will bring you great happiness, peace and joy. My Kingdom will astonish you, because of its astounding beauty. Many of you fear My Messages because you believe that the Second Coming means death - the end. But that would be an incorrect assumption.
Those of you who come to Me willingly, without any conditions, with humility and love, will not experience the pain of physical death. Instead, you will, in the blink of an eye, find yourself in your new surroundings. This will shock you at first and you will look around you quickly to find your loved ones. I will save so many souls that you will be with your families, including those who you love, who are already with Me in Heaven and those I will release from the fires of Purgatory.
Great rejoicing will take place everywhere. This will last 100 days. My New Paradise will have only one religion, the New Jerusalem, where I will be adored, daily. All will be in union with the Holy Will of My Father. There will be twelve nations, but only one language, for I will not permit division.
I will appoint leaders and in each nation there will be no shortage of food, water, homes or life. There will be no death, because I will give all those who enter, Eternal Life. All nations will work together to spread the Word of God, and happiness, which is impossible to attain on Earth today, will be one of the greatest Gifts I will present to you. You will be very much loved and you will love Me, just as I love you.
Many of you will meet generations of your families, going back centuries. Generations will continue and so you will see your sons and daughters marry and produce perfect children of God - each blessed with great Graces. There will be appointed, a Head of My Church and his name is Peter, for I promised that he would form My Church on Earth. And so, in the New Paradise he will head up My Church.
Oh if only I could show you what lies before you, you would cry tears of joy and fight your way to the Gates. So please, all of you, ignore attempts to stop you in your quest for Eternal Life. Ignore those who tell you that I do not Exist. Do not give credence to those who use My Holy Word to convince you that I do not speak to you now through these Messages.
You must fight for all of you to be given this glorious inheritance, for no man has the right to deny another this great inheritance, which belongs to every single one, no matter how blackened their souls may be. I Am giving you the tools to bring Me souls, everywhere, so that together we can destroy the work of Satan and move swiftly into the New World.
My peace be with you.

Your Jesus

Many of you, who say you serve Me, are not fit to stand up and declare yourself to be a servant of God
Saturday, August 31st, 2013 @ 21:45

My dearly beloved daughter, I told you all, some time ago, to plant seeds in order to feed you and your families, during the persecution. I do this for a reason. You must plant, even just a few seeds - pure seeds, which have not been tampered with by human interference. I will then multiply the fruit, which they will yield and all will have enough to eat when the world will experience great hunger. Those days are not far away and they will come about for a number of reasons.
The crops will be contaminated through the intervention of greedy farmers. The result crops will be unfit for you to eat. Then war will mean that few men will be able to till the land. Then there will be the fire, which will pour over the four corners of the earth, and everything will become barren. These terrible trials will be caused by the spread of evil, but many people will survive if they trust in Me. You must prepare now, as if a war is coming and as you would when food is rationed.Have plenty of water because everything you store will be multiplied by Me.
Please do not believe that I ask you to leave your homes for this is not necessary. A little preparation, where you offer help to each other, is all that is needed. My Precious Blood will cover all those who believe in My Warning to humanity for the time of the Third Seal to open will follow a time of war.
So many will ignore the Word of God, which is contained in the Book of Revelation. So many leaders and sacred servants in My churches, fail to respond to My prophet, just as they did before the flood.
I call to My sacred servants, now. Who do you believe in? Me, your Jesus or the ramblings of those who claim to be experts in theology, but who are ignorant of the Truth? Wake up. The Seals are being opened. Your duty is to help Me to save souls, but you have not remained alert to the sound of My Call. I have told you that I will come like a thief in the night. When that day comes it will be too late for souls who have not prepared.
The time for the trumpets to peal out their judgements will come quickly, no sooner than when the Seals have been laid bare. What then? Will you wake up and follow Me at that stage or will you lose Me more souls, while you hesitate? While you wait for others to lead the way?
I must remind you that your role is to save souls. You do this through a life where you are supposed to serve Me and not where you pander to the pride and ego of those who try to twist My Teachings. Many of you in My churches do not understand the meaning of My New Paradise and have failed to remind God's children of My Promise. You must remind them of the Truth - of the time, before the final day.
So many of you, though kind, good, loving and with a sincere commitment to My Church on Earth, forget about My Second Coming. What do you think this is and what have you learned? How many prophets would it take to convince you that the time is almost upon you?
When did you hear that God does not send His prophets to help prepare His children in the fight against the wickedness, which infests the human soul. And what gives you the right to assume that the Book of Revelation contains lies? You deny much of what it contains and you do not discuss it. Why? Don't you know that this means you deny the Word of God?
My Patience is tried. My Anger is great. Your stubborn refusal to accept My Gift of Intervention, to prepare you, insults Me. By persecuting those sacred servants who recognise Me, through these Messages, you deny others the Gift of Salvation. You are blind and your ignorance of My Teachings and the Word of God, which is contained in My Father's Holy Book - the Bible - is astonishing. You say you serve Me, but you do not know Me and so you do not see.
When your faith is weak, you cannot open your heart to Me. If you opened your heart to Me, you would be able to hear Me clearly, for you would be filled with the Holy Spirit. Sadly, many of you, who say you serve Me, are not fit to stand up and declare yourself to be a servant of God. You make Me ashamed and you shame My Name, when you publicly humiliate your flock in My
Name. You break every rule of God when you condemn those who follow these Messages, for you have not been given the authority to do this. Your love of self takes precedence over your love of Me, Jesus Christ and because of this, you are no longer fit to serve Me. You are too proud to stand before My Throne.
Your Saviour Jesus Christ

I chose twelve simple men, uneducated and ignorant of Holy Scripture, who were poor fishermen
Sunday, September 1st, 2013 @ 11:08

My dearly beloved daughter, when I walked the Earth and entered the Temples of God, to reveal the Truth, I was treated, at first, with patience. Many priests were astonished by what I knew and by Me, the humble Son of a carpenter. So they listened, with attention, as I explained more of what was expected of them, as laid down in My Father's Book.
I knew from the age of twelve what My Mission was and I began slowly, not revealing too much, before the time was right. I knew that I had to prepare the world for the Coming of the Messiah. I also knew, within a short period of time, that My Father's Church on Earth, would deny Me and say that I was a fraud.
I chose twelve simple men, uneducated and ignorant of Holy Scripture, who were poor fishermen. Why did I do this? I knew that the knowledge I would give them would be accepted as it was. Without any previous knowledge of Holy Scripture, they would not, therefore, compare My Teachings with the Holy Scripture and try to find fault by examining them carefully. This would have meant that many of them would not have had the nerve to spread the Truth. They were sneered at by those in high places in the Church, who claimed that ignorant men were not worthy to be chosen by God, to spread His Holy Word, over them. Surely, with their education in matters of spirituality and position in the Church of God, that God would only choose His Church to prophecise the Good Word. They failed to understand that God only chooses the humble and the ignorant, in this way, because they do not argue. They do not challenge and they have no fear of being rejected, for they know no better. God, remember, does not choose those who exalt themselves before others. This could never be.
This is why you, My daughter, are hated amongst My Church on Earth. This is why they pull My Messages apart and ridicule them. This is why they mock you, because you are not deemed worthy to spread My Holy Word. How they grieve Me. The hatred you will see will be influenced mainly by the Catholic Church. They will never accept that a prophet, who has no
knowledge of the Most Holy Bible or My Teachings, can be sent. They will say that you spread heresy. They say this because they are so far removed from My Teachings that they have begun to believe in their own lies. Know that My prophet for the end times has been sent and not chosen, for this could not be, as this, the Last Mission, has been created by My Father Who only sends His own.
I warn those of you who mock Me, by making little of these Messages - My Holy Word, you must come to Me, now, in Holy Adoration, immediately, every single day, until you hear My Voice. Only then can I take you and show you what I need from you at this crucial time in your service to God.
Your Jesus

Do those of you who mock Me now, because you reject My Messages, really believe that I would divide My Church
Sunday, September 1st, 2013 @ 17:05

My dearly beloved daughter, at last, you offer Me thanks for this very difficult Mission. I know how much pain it causes you to proclaim the Word of God, because it creates much anger amongst those who believe they are the elite.
My daughter, know that while I grant you favours, you will always walk alone and you will end up in the wilderness, just like the prophets before you. I will send some to help you, but you will always be isolated. But I will always keep you company, while the wolves will hunt you down.
Tell those who call themselves My true disciples, priests and sacred servants, amongst you, this. I will always hear the voices of the little, the weak, the humble and those pure of heart. Even if they are frightened of My Messages, I will always favour those who truly love Me. Who are these I speak of now? I refer to those who have never forgotten what I told them. Carry My Cross, follow Me, but be prepared, for when you declare the Word of God without malice, you will suffer My Pain. No matter how civilized you believe the world to be at this time, you will be hated when you stand up, defiantly, against those who hate Me. When they hate Me, they will crucify you.
I listen to the meek. I bless those who carry out My clear instructions to you, to love one another, no matter how they torment you. Those of you who reject Me, through these Messages, must never, because of your doubts, spread hatred against anyone in My Name. I, Jesus Christ, tell you now that the devil has come to declare this final assault on all of God's children. Those of you who refuse to listen to Me, will fall for the charm of his devout servants.
Don't you know that My Church will be attacked by Satan and that this has been foretold? My enemies will walk amongst you and, yet, you do not accept that I would allow this. Know that the Battle of Armageddon comprises of two sides. Those who believe in God and follow the Word of God and the evil one, his army and all those he deceives. Satan will deceive many in My Church and only those who remain alert and who watch out for doctrinal errors, will be able to withstand the seduction. The seduction is the most powerful tool used by the deceiver. He deceives by appearing to proclaim the Truth.
I urge those poor souls, those who love Me and who remain true to My Church on Earth, to listen. You must remain true to My Church and accept discipline, when your superiors remain true to what I gave the world, through My death on the Cross. The time for choice is close. The abomination has not happened yet, but when you see the errors, which go against My Teachings and My Gift of the Sacraments, walk away. That day is close. Then you must gather and continue to follow the Rules of My Church, as they were laid down before you by Peter.
Do those of you who mock Me now, because you reject My Messages, really believe that I would divide My Church and ask you to deny My Teachings? Wait until the day, when you are asked to swear allegiance to lies, in the Name of My Holy Church on Earth, before you dismiss My prophet. Only My Love for you is so strong do I not cast you aside and allow you to be devoured by demons.
Your Jesus

Don't you know that a whole generation of young people are removed from Me at this time
Monday, September 2nd, 2013 @ 18:45

My dearly beloved daughter, as the anger rises against these, My Prophesies, given to the world to prepare all of you for My Second Coming, know this. This Mission has one goal. That is to save all souls - everyone alive in the world today. It does not matter how harsh the criticism leveled against you is, My daughter, because I will forge ahead, relentlessly, until My job is done. No man will stop Me from saving souls, for I will trample on those who dare to stand in My Way, so that I can save those souls who have fallen from My Favour.
Because of the paganism which sweeps the Earth and the weakness of faith, which exists amongst believers, don't you know that a whole generation of young people are removed from Me at this time? My Mission focuses on such afflicted young souls, who in most cases were denied any knowledge of Me, Jesus Christ. Because there are so many, in every nation, I must reach out to them in whatever way is most likely to get their attention.
Remember, those Christians amongst you who have been fed the Word of God since you were young children are blessed. Because of this you have a duty to pray for the lost generation. Please, I ask you to pray for these young souls with this Crusade Prayer:
Crusade Prayer (118) For the lost generation of young souls

Dear Jesus, I call out to Your Mercy for the lost generation of young souls. For those who do not know You, cover them with the Gift of sight.
For those who do know You, but who ignore You, draw them back into Your Mercy.

Please give them the proof of Your Existence soon and guide them towards those who can help them and guide them towards the Truth.
Fill their minds and souls with the longing for You.

Help them to recognise the emptiness, which exists in them because they do not feel Your Presence. I beg You, dear Lord, not to forsake them and in Your Mercy grant them Eternal Life. Amen.
How I long to reach out to these young children and wrap My Sacred Arms around them, so that I can whisper Words of comfort into their ears and give them peace of soul. They are Mine and without them the New Paradise would be empty of those I pine for the most. Help Me to save them.
Your Jesus

Your life is but just a fleeting moment in your entire lifetime. You are in exile
Tuesday, September 3rd, 2013 @ 16:45

My dearly beloved daughter, it is My greatest desire to Call out to people all over the world, who have cut Me out of their lives, to come back to Me. Many souls, led by the idea that God may not in fact Exist, have decided to forget about Me, their beloved Jesus. I fret for these poor, confused people because I love them dearly and miss their company.
If you have wandered away from Me and find it difficult to reconcile your view of a modern fast-paced world with a simple belief in Me, Jesus Christ, then let Me help you to understand. You are separated from Me because of sin. When sin blights your soul, a darkness descends upon it and this makes it difficult to accept the Light of God. When this happens, your heart becomes hardened. And then your intellect becomes involved and this is when you will mistakenly believe that God could not Exist, because logic dictates that He can't.
Your life is but just a fleeting moment in your entire lifetime. You are in exile. The Truth lies in the future, when you will finally come home to God in your natural state. I understand how hard it is for man to remain close to Me as he faces so many distractions, temptations and darkness on Earth.
When you feel you cannot feel My Presence or My Love, I want you to recite this Crusade Prayer (119) To feel the Love of Jesus
Jesus help me, I am so confused. My heart won't open to You.
My eyes can't see You.

My mind blocks You.

My mouth cannot utter words to comfort You. My soul is clouded with darkness.
Please take pity on me, a poor sinner. I am helpless, without Your Presence.
Fill me with Your Graces, so that I have the courage to reach out to You, to beg You for Mercy.
Help me, Your lost disciple, who loves You, but who no longer feels love stir in my heart, to see and accept the Truth. Amen.

It is not easy to be in union with Me. You must persevere until you feel My Presence in your soul. Call Me and I will run and embrace your poor wretched soul and take you, lead you and bring you to your eternal salvation. No matter what you have done, you must never be afraid to call to Me. I respond to every sinner, no matter who they are. Not one of you is without the stain of sin. I await your call.
Your Jesus

I bring Gifts in stages, depending on the purity of the soul
Wednesday, September 4th, 2013 @ 18:00

My dearly beloved daughter, the Living God, present in humble souls, will become more pronounced as My New Gift is being poured over each of those alive in the world at this time.
I bring Gifts in stages, depending on the purity of the soul. My followers, in every church all over the world, will feel a rekindling of their love for Me as I envelop them with a greater understanding as to My Promise to Come again. My Gift will mean that they will be able to see, through the cobwebs of darkness, how the Truth begins to make sense. They will know now that I speak to them, because they will feel My Presence in their hearts. They will be blessed with knowledge, given to them by the Power of the Holy Spirit, to enable them to prepare adequately for My Second Coming.
My followers will be led by the Holy Spirit and they will not betray Me nor will they accept blasphemy, presented to them in My Name. This is why My Word will now spread more quickly and soon the Holy Spirit will create a longing in their souls for the Great Day when the final trumpet will peal out to announce My Coming.
Fear not, My beloved followers, I Am with you, though you suffer. Soon, you will grow in great numbers and this will give you the confidence to remain true to Me.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: Every single Sacrament will be changed beyond recognition
Thursday, September 5th, 2013 @ 09:35

My child, when they placed the Crown of Thorns on the Sacred Head of my Son, it was not just to inflict terrible physical torture, it was to make a statement. It was done as a symbolic gesture. They were saying as they mocked Him that this Man, Who says He is Head of the Church and Who calls Himself the Messiah, will not be tolerated. They defile the Head of the Church when they Crowned Him and they will defile Him again during these times.
It will not suffice that they, the enemies of Christ, take over my Son's Church from within - they will desecrate Him in many other ways. They will change the hosts for Holy Communion and the meaning of what the Holy Eucharist is. They will say that It, the Holy Eucharist, represents humanity and that it is a sign of a new communion - a gathering of all people as one in the Eyes of God. You, my children, will be told that you are all in communion with each other and that this is a cause for celebration.
The Holy Communion is the Body of Christ and is His Real Presence. It cannot be two different things. Yet, they will twist the meaning - all you will be left with, eventually, will be a piece of bread, for when they desecrate the altars and the Most Holy Host, my Son's Presence will cease.
Every single Sacrament will be changed beyond recognition. So cunning will the enemies of my Son be, that the holy ceremonies will be seen to have changed only a little. The Sacrament of Confession will be abolished, for the beast does not want souls to be redeemed, because this would be a victory for my Son.
Children, you must keep asking me to intercede, so that the pain of these future events can be eased and the time cut short. Your beloved Mother
Mother of Salvation

No sacred servant of Mine can condemn anyone in My Name
Thursday, September 5th, 2013 @ 14:30

My dearly beloved daughter, how few of those who believe in God, or who accept Me as the Son of Man, truly love Me. They say that they do, but many do not live according to My Teachings. You cannot say that you love Me and then condemn others. You cannot hurt another person, through harsh words and then say that you love Me, at the same time.
Who amongst you is free of sin? Which one of you exalts yourself before Me and then speaks cruelly against another? You will never be able to say you speak in My Name when you slander another. This is an affront to God and those of you who behave in this way offend Me. Those of you who speak evil of another, when you say you defend Me, only separate yourselves from Me.
Yet you think that your actions are justified. When did you think that I would uphold such behavior and why do you believe that you have the authority to do these things?
When you are committed to My Service and then speak cruel words against any of God's children, you commit a grave sin. No sacred servant of Mine can condemn anyone in My Name. You may be familiar with My Teachings - you may be knowledgeable about all that is contained in My Father's Book, but when you slander another, in My Name, I will cast you away. It will take much penance on your part to seek My Favour again and even then, until you beg Me to forgive you, it will be a long time before you are fit to come before Me again.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: A new, bitter world war will be declared
Friday, September 6th, 2013 @ 18:46

My dear child, I must, on the instructions of my Son, Jesus Christ, reveal that the wars, which will unfold now, in the Middle East, will herald the great battle, as a new, bitter world war will be declared.
How this breaks the Sacred Heart of my poor suffering Son. The hatred, which infuses the hearts of those leaders, entrusted with the responsibility of running their countries, by ordinary people, will spread. They will betray their own nations. Millions will be killed and many nations will be involved. You must know that the souls of those who will be murdered and who are innocent of any crime will be saved by my Son.
The speed of these wars will escalate and no sooner will four parts of the world become involved than the Great War will be announced. Sadly, nuclear weapons will be used and many will suffer. It will be a frightening war, but it will not last long.
Pray, pray, pray for all the innocent souls and continue to recite my Most Holy Rosary, three times a day, in order to ease the suffering, which will result because of World War III.
Thank you, my child, for responding to my call. Know that there is great sadness in Heaven at this time and it is with a heavy heart that I bring you this difficult news.
Your Mother Mother of Salvation

Mother of Salvation: The only way to Eternal Life is through my Son, Jesus Christ
Friday, September 6th, 2013 @ 20:15

My child, none of you must ever forget that my Son died in order to salvage humanity. He freed all souls from bondage to the beast. He gave all of you the Gift of Salvation and in order to receive Eternal Life, you must come to my Son and ask Him for this Great Gift.
The only way to Eternal Life is through my Son, Jesus Christ. Because He is so merciful, He allows everyone the chance to come to Him, by their own free will. He gave the world the Truth and, by His Gift of His death on the Cross, He opened the way for all to live in eternal peace and in His Paradise.
Many do not accept my Son nor do they believe in God. If you do not believe in God or accept the Gift of Salvation, then you separate yourself from God. Because of this Final Mission to save souls, including the souls of all sinners, as well as those who refuse to acknowledge the Existence of God, my Son will perform a Great Miracle. During The Warning everyone will see the proof that they have a soul and many will be converted. Those who will not convert and who remain atheists cannot be given the Gift of Salvation, for they will refuse His Hand of Mercy. Those souls will reject Him in the most defiant way and nothing, but your prayers, can save them.
Those who refuse every attempt, every intervention and every Mercy, to bring them into the New Paradise, will be cast away. For theirs will not be the Kingdom of my Son, because my Father, Who bequeathed humanity with the Gift of free will, will never impose His Will over any of His children.
Pray, pray, pray that atheists will accept the Hand of Mercy, which my Son will extend to every single one of them. Remember to recite the Crusade Prayers to save these poor little souls.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

My Holy Word may not be changed or adapted so that it becomes something else
Saturday, September 7th, 2013 @ 18:25

My dearly beloved daughter, while I continue to make every effort to reach out to the world, through these Messages - still many devout followers of Mine, fail to accept My Hand. These precious souls of Mine are vulnerable because many will fail to see the way in which their faith will be used to endorse the new, soon-to-be liturgy, which will fail to honor Me, Jesus Christ, the Son of man.
Many will assume, incorrectly, that the new liturgy and the new mass - although changed greatly - can do no harm. So many will quietly question some of the contents, as well as the format and find them strange. Yet very few will challenge them as they will believe that these are blessed by the Church and so therefore, they cannot be wrong. What they do not understand is that My Holy Word may not be changed or adapted so that it becomes something else. My Church is infallible, but should any so-called servant or leader in My Church twist the Word of God or rewrite the meaning of the Holy Eucharist, then they blaspheme against God.
I was denied by humanity and crucified when they, including the leaders in God's Temples, rejected the Truth. When anyone - no matter how high they stand amongst you - denies the Truth, they are guilty of heresy and do not come from Me. Yet, they would have you believe that the Truth is a lie. They will deny all that you have been taught by Me to live full Christian lives. They will spit at Me, but lead you along a path, which they will say leads you to Me, but it will not.
These things, foretold, will soon come to pass. Be prepared. When you see the signs, then know that these prophecies can only come from God.
Your Jesus

It is time that the Crusade Prayer Groups must be set up and spread across the world
Sunday, September 8th, 2013 @ 21:10

My dearly beloved daughter, it is time that the Crusade Prayer Groups must be set up and spread across the world. These Prayers are given by the Power of God and great miracles are associated with them.
These Prayers will spread conversion, provide physical healing and dilute the impact of war, hunger and poverty. Today I bequeath to you a new Prayer which will help to reduce the terrible suffering which will be brought on by war.
Crusade Prayer (120) Stop the Spread of War

O my sweet Jesus, take away the wars, which destroy humanity. Protect the innocents from suffering.
Protect the souls who try to bring true peace.

Open the hearts of those afflicted by the pain of war. Protect the young and vulnerable.
Save all souls whose lives are destroyed by war.

Strengthen all of us, dear Jesus, who pray for the souls of all God's children and grant us the Grace to withstand the suffering, which may be given to us during times of strife.
We beg You to stop the spread of war and bring souls into the Sacred Refuge of Your Heart. Amen.
Go, all of you who hear Me, and ask Me for the Graces you will need to endure My Pain at this time. Your Jesus

The more you are hated, My disciples, the more you are loved by God
Tuesday, September 10th, 2013 @ 23:45

My dearly beloved daughter, don't you know that, as more of you follow My Messages, you will be tormented by those who wish to silence My Voice?
As this Mission continues, by the Command of My beloved Father, every effort will be made by those, especially in My Church on Earth who oppose these Holy Messages, to force you to stop following them. These objections will increase and every kind of twisted logic, arrogant denial of the Truth and falsified theology, will be used to drown out the Voice of God.
The more you are hated, My disciples, the more you are loved by God, because only those who follow Me and live their lives according to My Teachings will suffer in this way. If you are exalted, favoured and chosen by the world as a living saint, where no fault is found or the error of your ways publicly identified, then you are not chosen by God, for you defy what is expected of God's servants. Without expressing the Truth and by twisting My Truth, in order to excel yourselves in the eyes of the world, you will be thrown to one side while I seek out My true servants.
My true servants love Me and are moved by My Holy Spirit. Their sorrow, which is expressed in their eyes, because they suffer with Me, can be seen clearly by those who have been given the Gift of the Holy Spirit themselves. Never do these pure souls condemn others or try to block the Word of God, for they are incapable of doing this.
You must pray hard at this time - all of you - for these holy servants of Mine are under attack because of Me. I stand with them, but many will fall and crumble under the pressure to remain silent when they are forced to present to their flock the doctrine of lies to come.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: You will be mocked for failing to recognise the new interpretation of Catholicism
Wednesday, September 11th, 2013 @ 16:30

My child, my Heart is entwined with that of my beloved Son, Jesus Christ, at this time of great sorrow when the persecution of all of God's children is increasing.
Every person in the world, particularly those without money, influence or possessions, will suffer because of the greed of those who control many nations. My Work to help my Son achieve the final part of His Covenant to save humanity has begun to be seen in many ways. I will, by the Power of God, guide all of those who are distraught with grief, because of the suffering in their lives, into the Refuge of my Son's Protection. Those who have to endure such poverty, such hunger, such anguish, such injustice - whatever it may be - will be comforted when you ask me to pray for you.
Those of you who have to suffer, because you bear witness to Jesus Christ, the Saviour of humanity, will be given extra strength at this time when you ask Me to help you. The greatest injustice within my Son's Church will soon be witnessed, where both ordinary believers and sacred servants alike, will be accused of disobedience against the Teachings of Jesus Christ.
You will be asked to take an oath - to be recited like the Apostles Creed - to declare your allegiance to an altered form of worshipping God. By swearing, through this oath, not acknowledged in the Most Holy Bible, you will place your soul in great danger. The liturgy will be changed and new additions declared, while other parts, recited for many years, will no longer be made known. This wicked plan will be justified because they will take all the attributes associated with my Son and declare these to be the reason for such changes.
This is why those of you who are loyal to my Son will find it deeply disturbing and your souls will suffer greatly. And while you will continue to pay homage to my Son, you will be mocked for failing to recognise the new interpretation of Catholicism and Christianity. You must never lose courage, during these trials, because you are, dear children, favoured by God and He will remain with you right up to the end.
Never turn away from the Truth. Never believe anything, which did not come from God. Your beloved Mother
Mother of Salvation

Those amongst you who suffer greatly and who may have lost all hope in life, know that you are in My Heart
Friday, September 13th, 2013 @ 23:15

My dearly beloved daughter, My Heart yearns for the world and everyone who lives in it and I promise you that I will do everything to unite all of you, God's children, within My Heart.
I love every man, woman and child, no matter who they are - whether they are powerful, rich, influential, humble, poor or just simple people, living ordinary lives. All of you were chosen to be born by My Father, Who created you. Each soul has a purpose and every one of you is a cherished child of God.
Those amongst you, who suffer greatly and who may have lost all hope in life, know that you are in My Heart and that I feel your pain deeply. I suffer within you. You must never give up hope, because I have a place for you in My
Paradise. When you give up hope, you are turning your back on your future, which is full of My Light. This future is My Gift to you and all is Mine. I will take away your worry. Just call to Me and say: "Jesus, take my terrible pain and suffering away and let me feel Your Love." and I will lift your heavy burden instantly.
When you feel empty and believe that no one truly loves you, you must know that I Am there beside you, because I will always love you, no matter how far away you have strayed. When you believe that you have nothing to live for, then know that My New Paradise will give you Eternal Life. But you must persevere with your suffering in this life first. Yet, I will ease your suffering and all you have to do is ask Me to.
Many of you feel worthless, unloved, unsuccessful, unfulfilled and of little use. You feel like this because the world is obsessed with so-called success and ambitions. Only the few, the elite, seem to achieve such great heights. The pressures created by the world's media to celebrate wealth and beauty only serve to destroy the confidence of ordinary man. It is not necessary to impress others. It is not necessary or desirable to impress Me with your so-called success. Work hard, by all means. Use the talents given to you by God, but use them in order to serve others and for the good of all. But know this. It is the weak, the humble of spirit and those with a simple love for Me, Jesus Christ, whom I will raise up to the greatest glory in My Kingdom. Those who suffer now will never suffer again in My New Paradise.
My Promise to come to gather you all will be fulfilled during My Second Coming. Look to this day with longing and joy, for it is not far away and then I will bring you the Gifts of love, joy, happiness and Eternal Life. Persevere and come close to Me. I Am with you. I will never desert you, but you must not separate yourself from Me because if you do, you will be lost to Me. Come, lay your head upon My Shoulder. Let Me comfort you. Let Me put an end to your sorrow. Let Me wipe your tears away. Let Me grant you My Peace.
I grant you a special Blessing now. Take it. Accept My Hand and all will be well. I love you.

Your Jesus

The doctrine of darkness - the great apostasy which will spring from the loins in My Church - will descend like a great thick mist
Saturday, September 14th, 2013 @ 03:00

My dearly beloved daughter, I Am the Voice in your midst, Who tries to make Myself heard among those leaders who spread apostasy and who rule in the four corners of the Earth.
The doctrine of darkness - the great apostasy, which will spring from the loins in My Church - will descend like a great thick mist upon all unsuspecting Christians very soon. The plan to suppress the Truth has begun and soon, twisted versions of My Holy Doctrine will become clear to many of you. But, while they will trade the Truth for lies, the Holy Spirit will rise against My enemies. My Light will still be visible amidst all the confusion, which the leaders of the greatest apostasy of all time will bring to bear on the world. They will not rest until the world become like heathen, with no love for Me, Jesus Christ.
The secular world will be deemed to be the just one, the one where each man will be encouraged to follow their own lusts and desires. Every attempt will be made to dampen the Presence of the Holy Spirit. They will deny My Suffering on the Cross and the significance of the need to earn salvation, though it be given to anyone who redeems himself to Me, and who asks for My Mercy. They will not just force feed God's children with lies about Me and My Teachings, they will persecute those who question such lies.
Those who challenge the leader of My Church, from within, will be dealt with ruthlessly and not a shred of mercy will be shown. Those of you who accept false doctrines, from those who say they represent My Church, and know in your heart that they could not come from Me, then I will help you. I will comfort you as I guide you. You must never deny the Truth or give into those whose lust for power means that they will lie in My Name, if they can remain on favourable terms with My enemies. Your faith will be truly tested.
I come now to bring you the Truth, only because you will be denied the Truth. When this happens, you will not be allowed to declare the Truth to other souls who cannot survive without it.
Pray for the Mercy of your own souls and for those who will be led into grave error by My enemies. Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: These Medals will convert all souls, who are open to the Mercy of my Son, Jesus Christ
Saturday, September 14th, 2013 @ 16:10

O, my child, just as I loved my Son, from the moment I looked into His beautiful Face, so do I love all of God's children as my very own.
I am the Mother of God, but I am also the Mother of all of God's children, as I pledged to help them in their moment of final salvation. My Son, when He crowned me at my Coronation in Heaven, gave me the authority to become the Mother of the twelve tribes - the twelve nations in the New Jerusalem.Before that day dawns, I, as the Mother of Salvation, will seek out souls everywhere and draw them to my Son. I help Him in this onerous task and just as my Heart is entwined in His, it is also entwined within the hearts of those who truly love my Son.
As your Mother, I love all of God's children. I feel the same love for each of you as any mother feels for her young. I see God's children as if all of them were just little children. I feel their pain. I suffer with my Son when He looks upon sinners, who reject the Love He has for them. How He agonises over them and how many tears I now cry as I watch the wretchedness of man grow because of the spread of sin. Yet, there is still much love alive in the world. This love, when it is pure, will withstand the darkness and, like a beacon, it will attract souls towards it. This is the way God will work in order to enlighten humanity. He will use the love of those who love Him to bring Him the souls of the rest.
My duty is to offer as many sinners as possible the chance to save their souls. I do this through the apparitions, which are witnessed when I appear, in order to ignite the faith of sinners everywhere. I now do this by providing the Medal of Salvation. My child, as I have said, this Medal must be made available to the world through you and based on my instructions to you. These instructions are only being made known to you. These Medals will convert all souls who are open to the Mercy of my Son, Jesus Christ. This will then result in the salvation of millions.
Thank you, children, for opening up your hearts to me, your Mother and for showing obedience to my beloved Son, Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankind.
Your Mother Mother of Salvation

My Plans to redeem the world are being brought to fruition. All is in place now
Sunday, September 15th, 2013 @ 23:50

My dearly beloved daughter, all of My Plans to redeem the world are being brought to fruition. All is in place. My Army is formed. They will now grow and expand everywhere, bringing along with them the many souls I yearn for. This Army has been given great Graces by Me and by the Power of the Holy Spirit they will keep the Flame of Christianity burning and they will carry the Torch of Truth until the Final Day. They will bring the Light of God into the darkest corner and they will open the eyes of millions to the True Word of God, as the apostasy devours My Church on Earth. I grant them this Crusade Prayer to help them pledge their allegiance to Me.
Crusade Prayer (121) Allegiance to the Army of Jesus Christ

We stand united to Your Sacred Heart, dear Jesus. We speak with authority the True Word of God.
We will walk to the ends of the Earth to spread the Truth.

We will never accept any new false doctrine in Your Name, other than that You taught us Yourself. We remain true, loyal and steadfast in our faith.
We will treat those who betray You with love and compassion, in the hope that they will come back to You. We will be firm, but patient, with those who persecute us in Your Name.
We will walk victorious all the way to Your New Paradise.

We promise, that through our pain and suffering, we will bring You all those lost souls who are starved of Your Love.

Please accept our prayers for all sinners in the world, so that we can become one family, united in love for You, in the New Era of Peace. Amen.
Go, My Remnant Army, in the knowledge that you will be given all the help and Graces to succeed in this last Holy Mission on Earth, so that I can gather all of God's children off the face of the Earth and bring them into My New Paradise.
Your Jesus

God the Father: For those born into pagan families, through no fault of your own, I will grant you Mercy
Monday, September 16th, 2013 @ 16:20

My dearest daughter, the human race is, to a large extent, impervious to My Existence. So many know little about Me, their Father, their Creator. My sacred servants, including all those who believe in Me, the Creator of all that is, have failed to prepare humanity for the punishment which will face them if they do not acknowledge the error of their ways.
A desire to believe that 'all will be well' has meant that many of My children do not believe in the existence of Hell. This is a place where people who refuse My Mercy, My intervention to save souls, go. Mortal sin, unless it has been erased through reconciliation, will lead souls into the abyss of Hell. Those who may not be guilty of mortal sin, but who do not believe in Me and instead believe in an existence which has been created and fabricated in their minds by false idols, have much to fear.
Reject Me, your Creator, and you will turn yourselves against Me. You will cut yourself off. Many of you, when the Truth of My Divinity is revealed to you, will fiercely oppose Me and nothing I do will save you from the fires of Hell. I can use every Divine Power, but I can never force you to accept My Mercy. Nothing, only the prayers of chosen souls, will help you. This means that you will never see My Face. Anyone who tells you it does not matter if you do not accept My Existence is lying. Only those who accept Me, and through the Mercy of My only Son, can enter My Kingdom. If you are a kind and loving soul and still reject Me - even when the Truth is made known to you - you, too, will also be cast away from Me. No Eternal Life will be yours.
I grant the Gift of Purification upon all of you now, but in particular to atheists and pagans. This Purification will be painful, but in many cases it will open their eyes to the Truth. For those born into pagan families, through no fault of your own, I will grant you Mercy. But for those of you who were given the Gospels and who know about the Existence of the Triune God and who now reject Me, there is little hope for you, until you turn back and atone for your sins. Then you must beg for the salvation of your soul.
Your Father

God the Most High

I come for you to take you to My Father. I come to fulfill His Divine Will and to complete the Covenant
Tuesday, September 17th, 2013 @ 22:45

My dearly beloved daughter, when you find this Work difficult and hesitate to give the world bad news, you must understand that you are only the messenger. You are an instrument of the Holy God, the Most High and it is your duty to respond to His Call. Your obedience is essential and you must not fear the repercussions, which may befall you as a prophet of the Lord.
All events foretold have been laid down in the beginning and form part of God's Plan to complete the Covenant to gather His children, finally, so that they can live in harmony in His Divine Will. The final battle between My Father's hierarchy and the evil one means that many people, who leave themselves exposed, will become infested by sin and will turn against their brothers who remain loyal to God.
When the battle is being fought many wicked atrocities will be carried out, by the enemies of God, against His beloved children. But as I have told you before, they can only go so far, because they do not have the power to destroy humanity, although they believe that they do.
Take comfort, all of you, because My Father will intervene with the wicked actions of those who want to control all nations and He will strike them dead - those who dare to hurt His children. Many poor souls will suffer during such persecutions, but My Father is ever-merciful. His Power cannot be touched. His Hand is Almighty. He can, at any time, cast away His enemies. But the prophecies foretold, and which must take place before My Second Coming, are a reality. They will unfold in a way, which may not be obvious to all of you, but know this. Prayer is your weapon. Prayer will provide you with the armour you need to defeat the evil one. Prayer will dilute the impact of war, suffering and every kind of persecution inflicted upon the human race by the enemies of God. Prayer will save you and all those for whom you pray. Your prayers will destroy evil and when the Great Day comes you will cry tears of joy when you witness the New Generation, those billions of people who have been salvaged because of your response to My Call.
While My Messages bring a mixture of sadness, fear, frustration - they also bring hope because they create much conversion. My Father's Plan is unknown to most of you. What you need to understand is this. His Plan will destroy all His enemies. By allowing all these trials to take place, He will free the human race, at last, from its bondage to sin. Be patient. Be calm. For soon joy, love and peace will finally be yours for eternity.
I come only because we are as one - one holy family in God's Kingdom. I come for you to take you to My Father. I come to fulfill His Divine Will and to complete the Covenant. I come to bring you the Truth.
Your loving Saviour Jesus Christ

At My Second Coming, I will judge every person who remains alive on the Earth at that time according to what they have done for the Glory of God
Wednesday, September 18th, 2013 @ 17:08

My dearly beloved daughter, when I said that I would come again to judge the living and the dead, I meant just that. The First Judgement must be fulfilled and by this, I mean that at My Second Coming I will judge every person who remains alive on the Earth at that time, according to what they have done for the Glory of God. My Judgement will be harsh, for My Mercy will have, by that stage, already been poured over the Earth.
Those amongst you who remain defiant to the end, through your rejection of Me - although the Truth will have been made known to you - will be cast away from Me. You will never accept My Mercy, no matter how I plead for your salvation. Your denial and hatred of Me will bring you eternal suffering and I will shed bitter and sorrowful tears for you. Oh how you will crave the comfort of Earth, though you wasted your time there in the wicked pursuit of sinful pleasures and power and where you oppressed others. Earth will seem like a long lost paradise when you scream for My Help in the depths of darkness.
Those amongst you who love Me, but whose souls have been blighted by sin, must have no fear for I will devour you with My Mercy when you ask for it. All sinners will be saved once they redeem themselves in My Eyes, no matter how grievous their sins are.
The living who are in My Favour will be lifted into My Glorious Paradise. They include every sinner, every creed, every race, who have called out to Me, their Saviour, the Son of man, and all those who ask Me to save them.
I will raise the dead, those who have been purified in the depths of Purgatory, as well as those who are awaiting, patiently, in Heaven, for the arrival of this Great Day. The rest will be banished.
Your time on Earth has been decided by My Father and this day is still unknown to Me, but I tell you this. You, of this generation, will be gathered and taken into My New Paradise when Heaven and Earth will become one. You have been given the time to prepare, so use it for good measure, so you can have Eternal Life and share it with your loved ones. I now ask you to consecrate every loved one, your family, your friends and your nations to Me, so that I can cover them with the Protection of My Precious Blood.
Your Jesus

Recite this special Crusade Prayer to consecrate all those close to you so that I can cover them with My Precious Blood.
Wednesday, September 18th, 2013 @ 23:30

My dearly beloved daughter, I ask that you all recite this special Crusade Prayer to consecrate all those close to you, so that I can cover them with My Precious Blood.
Crusade Prayer (122) For the consecration to the Precious Blood of Jesus Christ

Dear Jesus, I ask You to consecrate me, my family, friends and nation to the Protection of Your Precious Blood.

You died for me and Your Wounds are my wounds as I gracefully accept the suffering, which I will endure in the lead up to Your Second Coming.
I suffer with You, dear Jesus, as You try to gather all of God's children into Your Heart, so that we will have Eternal Life. Cover me and all those who need Your Protection with Your Precious Blood.
Amen.

All you need to do is trust Me and I will protect those who call on Me for the salvation of their own and other souls.

Go and prepare for the Day of the Judgement. I bless you all and I grant you the strength to continue with your devotion to My Crusade Prayers.
Your Jesus

No man, no priest, no bishop, no cardinal, no pope, has the authority to rewrite the Word of God
Thursday, September 19th, 2013 @ 19:26

My dearly beloved daughter, My poor sacred servants will, after the Liturgy has been tampered with and desecrated before Me, come running to Me in great sorrow. Only when that happens, will they realise that the Word of God is being made known through God's prophet, and that it is the Truth. The Word of God is the Truth. It can only be the full Truth or not at all, if the prophecies given to God's children are from Him.
Many will gather and unite to prepare to pay homage to Me, in the way which honours Me, for nothing will stand in their way to uphold My Holy Word; My Holy Sacraments; My Holy Mass and the Most Holy Eucharist. But even then, many will not see the errors, which are going to be presented to unsuspecting souls.
Only when the Church of God is declared to be in union with pagans, and their ludicrous practices, will more of My sacred servants truly understand what is happening. Only when the pagan symbols and satanic signs begin to be shown inside of, upon and at the exterior entrances to Christian Churches, will they run for their lives. There will be great fear in their hearts, because many of them, at that stage, will have nowhere to go, as they failed to prepare for this day. These will be the ones who will be hunted down because they did not respond to My Call. Their pride and their egos prevented them from recognizing My Voice. So many of My sacred servants will be caught unawares, and many will be powerless against the reign of the false prophet and his cohort, the antichrist. These two will be ruthless in their quest to control all nations and anyone who dares to stand in their way will be destroyed.
While those sacred servants within My Church on Earth will be trapped, unless they are prepared, it is the souls of the faithful, the loyal followers of Me, Jesus Christ, who will be misled into grave error, which causes Me such bitter sorrow. Many will be afraid to show disloyalty to the Church, even when My Teachings, My Holy Doctrine, and all the Sacraments have been altered. Let them know now that no man, no priest, no bishop, no cardinal, no pope, has the authority to rewrite the Word of God. When they do this, they have broken God's Law. Only the Church of God, which remains faithful to My Teachings, is infallible. Once that bond - the bond where only the Truth is declared in My Name - is broken, they become separated from Me. I Am the Church. You, My followers, My sacred servants, are part of Me when you adhere to My Holy Doctrine.
The Church - My Church - will remain intact, for the Truth can never change. Those who separate from Me can not be part of My Church on Earth.
Your Jesus

Four powerful empires will emerge as the main source from which wars will be surmounted
Saturday, September 21st, 2013 @ 12:22

My dearly beloved daughter, much will happen in the world as the power of the false prophet rises and anyone who dares to challenge him will be ignored, even in the highest places within My Church.
Political disagreements will result in four parts of the Earth. Four powerful empires will emerge as the main source from which wars will be surmounted. As these empires increase in power, they will control many parts of the world, but not all, as this would not be permitted by My Father.
Each of these nations will fight amongst themselves, although they will claim to be working together. As mistrust builds, they will each try to outdo the other and then the fighting will bear forth. They will destroy many parts of their poor nations. The people over whom they will govern will have little power left, where democracy will hang like a thread. It is these innocent and suffering people who will be given the Protection of God if they have the Seal of the Living God.
Never underestimate this free Gift from God. The Seal of the Living God will protect you from physical and spiritual death during wars. Please get this to as many people as you can in every nation.
Egypt and Syria will be embroiled in a power struggle ,which will have repercussions for Israel. The enemies of the Jews are many. All wars which target and involve these two countries will result in a final battle, which will involve Israel and they will suffer the worst genocide witnessed since the Second World War.
The demise and rise of Jerusalem is foretold and these battles must take place before the prophecies are fulfilled. Your Jesus

Many will betray Me by accepting falsities
Saturday, September 21st, 2013 @ 13:45

My dearly beloved daughter, My Power will surge within the hearts of believers now as they, through the Power of the Holy Spirit, will feel a sense of calm despite the great apostasy, which they are beginning to witness in My Church.
I will, by the Power and the Glory of My beloved Father, give you, My cherished disciples, great strength and courage during these trials. You are being given these Gifts through the Crusade Prayers, because without them you would find it impossible to withstand the religious persecution, which lies ahead. You are being given these Gifts so that you can save the others, who will refuse My Call from Heaven and who will wander, innocently, into the lion's den, where all Hell will break loose. Once, within the den of darkness, they will be swept up into pagan rituals. Their souls will be opened up to the spirit of evil and, within a very short period of time, they will become blind to the Truth - the Holy Word of God, laid down since the beginning.
Many will betray Me by accepting falsities. Yet, they were given the Truth by My death on the Cross. Many of My disciples, when I walked the Earth, betrayed Me on the days leading up to My Crucifixion. Imitating the Pharisees, they shouted these words: "Get away from me, You speak heresy. You mock the Pharisees, who speak in the Name of God. You are a liar and You speak evil. You are the son of Satan."
Now that I prepare all of you for My Second Coming, you will spit out these very same accusations again. I come now, through these Divine Messages from Heaven, to bring you the Truth, although you know all about Me. I do this for the Truth will be abolished in My Church. You will soon accept lies in My Name and the Truth will be nowhere to be found.
Remember these Words. I come only to complete My Promise to My Father. I come to bring you the final salvation you were promised. Satan does not want this to happen, yet he cannot stop Me. But what he will do is to prevent many of God's children from accepting My final Mercy. He will do this through the help of My enemies, whom he has now seduced within My Church on Earth.
Wake up those of you who are asleep. I will come like a thief in the night. Only those who are prepared will be saved. Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation for priests: To remain true to the Church of my Son on Earth you must be prepared to feed His flock
Monday, September 23rd, 2013 @ 13:30

My child, many signs will be made known from the Heavens, upon the roofs of my Son's Churches, when the final changes are made in the Liturgy of the Holy Mass. All those who keep their eyes open and their ears alert will witness the Anger of my Son in a way in which they cannot fail to notice.
My Son promised that He would make known His Anger when they, within His Church on Earth, crucify Him again by defiling His Body and Blood during the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Thunder and lightning, followed by great storms, will sweep people off their feet. More floods will be witnessed, when the sins of man will be swept away as they begin to see punishments from God, which will pour down upon humanity.
Slaves to sin - even those who love my Son and who remain loyal to the Holy Mass - and so they will not know the difference when the abomination is presented. Remember, it is to commemorate the death of my Son that the Holy Mass is said and where the True Presence of my Son is made known. Soon, they will not acknowledge the Truth and the new mass will become a pagan ceremony. That day is still to come and it will happen suddenly and unexpectedly - so fast will the false prophet move. Now is the time for preparation. All those sacred servants, who are to remain loyal to the Most Holy Eucharist and who will adhere to the Holy Word of God, must begin their preparations now.
To remain true to the Church of my Son on Earth, you must be prepared to feed His flock with the Food of Life, that is His Holy Eucharist. This is the vow you made to Jesus Christ when you said you would serve Him and provide His Body and Blood, through the Holy Mass, to all those who seek salvation. This vow must be honoured until the last day.
Do not fear the times ahead, when the enemies of God will try to use His Holy Name to condone sin and make it acceptable to all; when they will deprive all of His Body and Blood. This will not matter if you continue to serve my Son in whatever way you can.
Go in peace in the hope that all of you who love my Son will be blessed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit, so that you will be able to discern the Truth.
Your Blessed Mother Mother of Salvation

The four parts of the world I refer to are the four big empires - the US, Russia, Europe and China
Tuesday, September 24th, 2013 @ 11:18

My dearly beloved daughter, the four parts of the world I refer to are the four big empires - the US, Russia, Europe and China. All prophecies foretold will involve these powers, around which all the upheavals in religious and political structures will occur.
Syria and Egypt, through the unrest in their countries, will become the catalysts for a greater war, which will involve the four great powers. Each of these powers will be connected in order to create a unified regime, which will be used to control the global wealth and population.
The religious war will be central to this control and the appointed leaders in My Christian Churches will be overcome and destroyed in preparation for the beast, who will control all four empires. None of the rulers, who defy the Word of God or who try to destroy His children, will be given the authority by God to take, by force, those whose names are in the Book of the Living. And while I speak of Christians and the need for them to remain true to Me, I also refer to the Jews because their protector, Michael the Archangel, will watch over them and help them to withstand the persecution which they, as God's chosen people, will also have to endure.
God's Plan has been created and all the angels and saints in Heaven prepare now, to help Me in My Mission to unite all and protect those who love Me from the great deceit, which has been created to fool the world. Never before has the wickedness against God been so co-ordinated by the human race as it is today. Never before has mortal man been capable of inflicting so much suffering, through the seizure of power in order to control, as it has at this moment of time in history.The great persecution against God's children, created by Satan with the willing support of evil, power hungry men and women, in positions of great power, is unfolding before your eyes. Yet, many of you cannot see because you have been fooled.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: Only a few will be brave enough to openly proclaim the Word of God during the Crucifixion of my Son's Church on Earth
Wednesday, September 25th, 2013 @ 12:15

My child, the Crucifixion of my Son's Church on Earth has well and truly commenced and all the signs have begun to be seen. Just as my Son was nailed to the Cross, only one of His apostles stayed with Him to the end and so too, will few of His disciples on Earth, dare to be seen to defend His Mystical Body on Earth, as it is plundered, persecuted and then annihilated.
Very few of those who swore allegiance to my Son watched His scourging or walked alongside Him on the climb to Mount Calvary. I only had four loyal disciples - my cousin Mary; Martha; Mary Magdalene and John - to hold me up and help me in my agony as I had to witness my Son's terrible torture. Many will follow my Son's instructions, through these holy Messages for the world, but only a few will be brave enough to openly proclaim the Word of God during the Crucifixion of my Son's Church on Earth.
My sorrow at this time is great as all that was foretold by me during the apparitions at La Salette and Fatima are now unfolding before you all, but many of you are blind. Those of you who dedicated hours before me at my most holy shrines must come and ask me, your Mother, to open your eyes to the Truth. You must ask me to consecrate your hearts and souls to my Son, otherwise you too will deny Him.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

God the Father: If I have to destroy cities to stop evil from spreading, then I will do this
Thursday, September 26th, 2013 @ 17:55

My dearest daughter, My Hand of Justice has fallen over the world and I will punish those who hurt My children, in body and soul. You must fear My Wrath as well as accept My Mercy.
I will intervene in your nations in order to stop wars from escalating and if I have to destroy cities to stop evil from spreading, then I will do this. As the wickedness of man spreads like a virus, I will cut those souls in two and strike them down. How the evil sins of abortion, war, murder and the deceit of those who assist in the spread of sin sicken Me. They will pay the price for this now.
Those in political positions, who control the availability of abortion, will be the first to be punished. Await now as you will see how they will suffer for the atrocities which they condone before Me. Those groups, who plot the demise of the world's population through abortion, will die in agony by My Hand. Justice will be served on them finally, as I will no longer allow them to inflict such wickedness on My children. Their arrogant claims, that they are acting in human interest, will be silenced, for they have cut themselves from Me and now they will have little time to redeem their souls.
Those given the responsibility of teaching My children the Truth of the Gospels will need to heed this Promise. I will raise you up when you tell the Truth, but I will throw you into the abyss, if and when you desecrate the Holy Eucharist. And while the liars will convince you of the need to change the Truth and persecute you, it will be nothing like the darkness, which I will cast over the entire Earth. Then there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, but no one will hear you. You will no longer see, nor will you hear anything, but you will feel the pain of those souls whom you destroyed because of the apostasy, which you helped to fuel until it enveloped the souls of those sacred servants you instruct.
Fear My Wrath, for it will descend on you suddenly and by then it will be too late for you. You will never see My Face. I Am giving the leaders of all those who control My Churches on Earth this final warning.
Failure to defend the Word of God or to uphold the Holy Eucharist will result in death and despair. I will not allow you the time to destroy the souls who have been earmarked by My enemies.
Your Father

God the Most High

My True Church will be thrown out of Rome and will have to endure a number of years of desolation
Saturday, September 28th, 2013 @ 15:23

My dearly beloved daughter, always remind those who believe in Me, but who have no idea that My Second Coming draws close, that they must always be alert to the signs which were prophesied in My Father's Book, for the time which precedes the Great Day.
The great apostasy is the first sign. This is when belief in the Truth - the Word of God - disappears and when sin is glorified in every part of the world.The sign for when My Second Coming draws very close is when the great apostasy grips My Church on Earth from within. When you see those who say that they have been appointed by Me to lead My Church on Earth engage in the secular world in order to gain favour, you will know that the changes have begun. When you see the Great Sacrifice - My Crucifixion - being debated and new meanings attached to My Eucharist, you will know that My Church will be cast into the desert.
By My Church, I refer to those who do not deviate from the Truth and who continue, as before, to accept the Word of God. My True Church will be thrown out of Rome and will have to endure a number of years of desolation. It will be trampled upon by the heathen and will suffer, but by My Grace, it will remain intact and those brave souls who refuse to desert Me will be given extraordinary Gifts by Me. As the abominable, so called 'miracles', healings and gestures of false humility and love for humanity are witnessed in the shell of My Church, the true miraculous interventions by Me will be seen. I will, through My Crusade Prayer Groups, make known to those who scoff and mock them, the Presence of the Holy Spirit. Many miracles will be bestowed upon My Prayer Groups and those who recite the Prayers as a gift to help My beloved disciples cope with religious persecution.
The persecution I speak of is mainly a spiritual one. My true disciples, and I mean all Christians, of every denomination, everywhere, will watch in great sorrow when they have to bear witness to the great deceit, which will descend over the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church will embrace the secular world and will declare mortal sin to be no more. Sin will not be acknowledged and in order to deceive the innocents, they will be told that it is not difficult to enter My Kingdom.Confessions will stop in the present format. People will be told to ask for redemption in their own way, and as such, many will not then bother to ask for My Forgiveness. They won't do this because they will no longer accept that sin is caused deliberately and, because of this, that God will forgive all. This is the error which was foretold and which will lead millions into the fires of Hell and they will be led there by the false prophet and the antichrist.
Soon, all pagan feasts and festivals will be integrated within the Catholic Churches everywhere. Pagans and those who hate God will be invited onto the altars in front of the tabernacles. This feast will be declared to be the new form of Communion - all God's children joining together in order to respect each other's beliefs and human rights. You, My followers, will be asked to show respect for those who want to destroy My Presence in the Holy Eucharist. You will be accused of being anti- Christian if you do not embrace paganism. This is how you will all be fooled. This is how I, Jesus Christ, will be desecrated. They will do the same in schools, in order to banish Christianity. They will do the same in political circles, when everything to do with Me will be wiped out. No other religion will be targeted with such hatred. Christianity, because it is the Truth, will be destroyed.
What you do not realise is, that by becoming willing participants in this wicked desecration, that your souls will be darkened and in time you will forsake your own salvation.
Betray Me and I will forgive you. Deny Me and I will forgive you. But, when you desecrate Me and swear allegiance to the beast, you become completely separated from Me and you will find it impossible to accept My Mercy.
Your Jesus

Ecclesiastical masonry has now reached the greatest level of power within My Most Holy Church on Earth
Monday, September 30th, 2013 @ 15:45

My dearly beloved daughter, I must ask all of My sacred servants to watch out for the summons to attend retreats, which will be introduced to persuade them to agree to a new oath of allegiance, which will render useless - should they agree to do this - their most sacred vows, which they made to Me, Jesus Christ.
Ecclesiastical masonry has now reached the greatest level of power within My Most Holy Church on Earth and it will soon dictate its new liturgy, which will be in defiance of My Most Holy Will. Created by the enemies of God and disguised as a new adaptation to suit political powers, who want to ban Christianity, it will be presented so quickly that many within My Church will be astonished. They will be pained to see such an abomination, but the voices of My loyal servants will not be heard in public, for they, the Masons, control how this new liturgy will be perceived in every way. Every objection raised in dioceses throughout the world will be dismissed and cast aside. The excuse will be that the Church needs to recruit new young souls who have fallen away from it. By appealing to a secular world, they will say that this will convert more people through a new liturgy.
Oh how deceitful this abomination will be and how many will fall for the lies, which will lead so many away from the Truth. The Book of Truth was foretold to the prophet Daniel so that God's children would never forget the Truth when they are drowning in the lies which will devour My Church on Earth.
Accept the Truth laid down by My Church on Earth. Do not accept the new laws, which you will be forced to accept in My Holy Name, which will amount to sacrilege.
Your Jesus

There is a great misconception as to what makes a man or woman holy in My Eyes
Wednesday, October 2nd, 2013 @ 22:15

My dearly beloved daughter, there is a great misconception as to what makes a man or a woman holy in My Eyes.

Many people in the world find the practice of the Christian Faith difficult to embrace when it comes to prayer. So many good and well-meaning people find it hard to sit quietly in peaceful contemplation of My Great Lessons given to the world in order to make them understand what is expected of them. I do not make great demands. I do not force souls to spend hours and hours before Me and yet, I Am so happy when humble souls do this - but it is a rare thing.
This is how I wish to develop an intimate relationship with all of God's children. I just need to hear your little voice call out to Me when you would like to share your private thoughts; your sorrows; your joy; your worries; your failures and your longing for Me, so that I can make Myself Present and witnessed by you.
Never before in the history of the world will God permit Himself to be felt, within the souls of those who will seek Him out now - through Me, His only Son. By the Power of God, the Father, the Most High - I come before even the most lowly, the most unworthy, the most confused, the most tormented of spirit, to give you the Gift to witness My Presence. How do I do this? How will you know that I communicate with you? I will fill you first with the tears of conversion. You will begin to feel great sorrow as you relive My Crucifixion. You will begin to see life, even in everyday situations, through My Eyes. You will be drawn to others, who have been filled already with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.
I do not choose those you believe are more worthy, more holy, more blessed, more disciplined, than you. I choose only those who come to Me in total humility, where their own free will has been willingly abandoned by them, so that it can become My Will.
If you truly love Me, you will know true peace. If you truly love Me you will say to Me:

"Jesus Your Will is all that matters. My free will is Yours. Do with it as You may."

When a soul tells Me this, they are true servants of Mine and they are the reason I can save the rest of those who are too stubborn to recognise the meaning of being in union with Me.
I can do many things and create many miracles, when the free will, given to every person by My Father, is offered back to Me, His Son. This is the greatest power, which will eliminate the power of the beast when he comes to power. Come to Me and gift your free will to My Father, in order to bring freedom to the human race. Please recite this special Crusade Prayer:
Crusade Prayer (123) Gift of free will to God:

My dearest Jesus, hear this prayer from me, a most unworthy soul, and help me to love You more. By my free will, I offer You this Gift back, dear Jesus, so that I can become Your humble servant and remain obedient to the Will of God.
My will is Your Will. Your Command means that I am obedient to Your every desire.

My free will is Yours to do with it what it is that is needed to save all people, all over the world, who are separated from You. I grant this Gift, which was given to me at birth, to Your Most Holy Service. Amen.
The more you begin to know Me, the more you will understand two things. My Teachings have never changed. I love all souls. Your Jesus

As the Crucifixion of My Church on Earth commences, you must watch out for all the signs, which were foretold
Thursday, October 3rd, 2013 @ 22:35

My dearly beloved daughter, as the Crucifixion of My Church on Earth commences, you must watch out for all the signs, which were foretold.
The enemies of God will emulate every aspect of My Own Crucifixion, beginning with the desecration of My Body. When I was dragged before My executioners, they stripped Me naked, in order to mock Me and cause Me shame. They then dressed Me in red - the colour associated with the beast. They then fought over who would drive the first nail into My Body. Then, like savages, they tore at My Limbs and stretched My Arms so far that they pulled them out of My Sockets, so as to cause Me extra pain. To make Me suffer more, they drove the nails through the palms of My Hands at an angle so that they exited through My Wrists. My two Arms were pulled at two awkward angles and I hung at a painful, unusual angle, designed to cause Me the maximum amount of pain and humiliation.
They drew lots so that the final eight men could preside over the bloody torture they inflicted upon My Body. They chanted obscenities, slapped and punched Me, kicked Me in the stomach and roared like savages. They defiled Me in every way to show all those who witnessed My death on the Cross that I was being punished for My so-called wicked lies. I was murdered to keep Me silent and to prevent the Word of God from reaching souls.
The same will happen soon. It won't be enough for My enemies to change the Presentation of My Eucharist - they will defile My Body once more. They will desecrate Me in similar ways. The colour red will be used; they will make gestures before My Cross and insult Me by their new rituals. Only those who recognise the signs will discern how these sacrileges will be enthusiastically presented to the world, amid great pomp and splendor.
The new homilies will be a nonsense and much of the new liturgy will not make sense. To those who know My Teachings, be aware of the confusing, illogical and complicated statements, which will accompany the introduction of the new, revised teachings and creeds of old. They will not only confuse and create great unease in your soul, they will be full of contradictions and lies, which could never come from Me, Jesus Christ.
You have been given the Truth since the time I walked the Earth. You will now be given the lies, designed to make you turn from God. Make sure that you are alert, for you will be swallowed up and taken into false doctrine. The doctrine of darkness, planned meticulously for many years, will soon descend upon you. You must never accept promises, which contradict My Word. When you see these things happen you will know that they have been brought to you by the spirit of evil, in order to destroy your chance of eternal salvation.
Your Jesus

Deny sin and you deny Me
Friday, October 4th, 2013 @ 23:44

My dearly beloved daughter, no man can fight Me and expect eternal salvation, unless he surrenders in full to Me. All of God's children must know that the time is drawing close when the world must know that My Final Call is almost upon them.
Never fear My Call. Welcome it, for I bring you Love, Peace and Salvation. Ignore Me at your peril, for I only give you so much time to respond to My Call from Heaven.
You, My beloved followers - no matter who you are - will find yourselves isolated soon and cut off from My True Presence. My Presence, My Word and the True Teachings of God are to be banished and you will find yourselves in a very lonely state. Those of you who scoff and mock these, My Holy Messages of Love to the world, will be left wondering how this can be, when you follow the path of deceit. The further you walk along this path, the greater the distance you will put between your souls and My Mercy.
When you love Me, you will believe in My Teachings. If you know Me, you will recognise My Holy Word in the Scriptures. If you know Me and accept that I would ever allow My Holy Word to be turned into something that it is not, without intervention on My Part, then you cannot say you know Me. If you believe that I, the Son of man, Who died a brutal death, on your behalf, to save you from sin, could sit back and condone such a situation, then you deny the Word of God.
Deny sin and you deny Me. Accept sin as being a good thing or believe, for one minute, that I will excuse it, without reconciliation, then you can no longer claim a place in My Kingdom. I warn you that this period ahead of you will lead you on the most dangerous path of destruction, unless you remain true to My Holy Word.
My Word is Eternal. My Kingdom is yours when you accept My Word as it was given to you. Dare to tamper with it or accept any form of new adaptation and you will suffer for this. My Anger is rising now, as I see how little respect many of you show towards the Truth as it was written in My Father's Book. There can be no other Truth. Any form of deviation can never be accepted by God. No arguments. No human reasoning. No exceptions. The Truth will live for Eternity. Lies will drive you into the arms of the beast.
Your Jesus

You will soon be told to use your faith to create a political campaign around the world to save the poor
Sunday, October 6th, 2013 @ 23:30

My dearly beloved daughter, the voice of the false prophet roars about all that is sacred in My Church. Little, however, will be said about the importance of upholding God's Teachings, Sacraments and the Proclamation of the Truth. Instead, you will see diversions, such as looking after the world's poor and hungry, and this will be deemed to be your first task as servants of God.
As servants and followers of God in the Church, your first allegiance is to the Truth of what I told you. Loving the poor and the hungry and helping them is a good thing, but My Church on Earth has a much bigger role, which was sworn to Me. This includes the teaching of the Truth in everything I taught you and you will do this, if you truly love Me.
The Church has a Mission to teach the Truth of My Teachings. Taking one aspect of My Word, to help the poor is admirable, but misleading, as My Teachings clearly state that you must help the poor in soul. Help them to cure their soul, before you help them to be free of life's afflictions. If I give you a poor man and ask you to help him, how would you do this? Give him clothes? Money to feed his family? Or, would you have Me save his soul first?
You will soon be told to focus all your attention on the world's poor. You will be asked for money - and this will be taken from different sources to help the world's poor, jobless and homeless. You will be told that I, Jesus Christ, always loved the poor. The problem is this. I seek out the poor of spirit first - to free them away from their lost lives. The poor of soul - those who have little spiritual feeling for God - are the ones I crave. Blessed are those who are poor in this life, with little to show for it, but who love Me, for these people are not poor at all. The rich man, who has no love for Me, is in more need of My Love, My Mercy, My Compassion, than those who are forced to find food, clothes and shelter. How you love Me and how you ask Me to save you is what you need to pay attention to. The Sacraments will be the saving force of those who are rich and poor, but who have no love for Me.
You will soon be told to use your faith to create a political campaign around the world to save the poor by leaders in My Churches everywhere. Nothing will be said to encourage you to prepare for My Second Coming, for they will not dare to prepare you for this Great Day. They would rather take your mind off Me by asking you to spend more time honouring the works of the false prophet.
Very shortly, statues, relics, posters, cups and large commissioned paintings will be made of the false prophet to be placed in Churches everywhere. His image, along with the antichrist, in time, will adorn many public places, churches, political centres, as well as, in countries where their parliaments will be seen to embrace the Catholic Church in a 'new light.' This will create a new form of false evangelism, and because it will appeal to a modern secular society, it will attract admirers from all over the world.
Not one word will condone the importance of the Holy Sacraments, as they were given to the world or the important Graces, which they yield. Instead, each will be played down - extra meanings added, in order to appeal to those who deny them as they are.
This will be in the hope that the abomination of the desecration of My Sacraments will be offered to as many people as possible, to take them away from God, so that the enemies of God can complete their pact with the devil.
The devil will deceive many who belong to My Church in this time in history. He will do this in the most charming and convincing way and he will justify lies when his servants will say that I would approve of these new changes. I, Jesus Christ, will be misquoted in order to win over souls. My Teachings will be twisted in order to destroy My Church and steal those souls closest to Me. Millions will accept the lies, without a care in the world. You must pray for them in the hope that they will realise, in time, that something is wrong.
When I appoint leaders and when a chosen soul has been appointed to spread My Holy Word, within My Church on Earth, the Truth is always straightforward, clear, concise, and straight to the point. When you are being lied to, through the influence of the spirit of evil, you will become confused. Phrases won't make sense. So-called improvements, presented by enemies within My Church, mean that the Truth is not 'good enough.'
My Word, My Sacraments, My Teachings do not need to be improved upon, for they came from Me. I Am God. I Am Perfect. My Word remains forever. Any man who tampers with My Most Holy Word is an enemy of God. My Anger is great at this time and any man who treats My Body, the Most Holy Eucharist, with disrespect and says he leads My people, know that this is untrue. I would never request a leader in My Church to change the Word of God, by introducing new meanings or new interpretations. This could never be.
Your Jesus

God the Father: Satan and his demons have recruited a very large army
Tuesday, October 8th, 2013 @ 15:40

My dearest daughter, My Divine Powers are given to all of My children who turn to Me, asking Me - through My Son - to sustain them during these times of great trials on Earth.
Sin is so rampant that My Son now suffers the same Agony, which He endured for each of you on the Cross. Sin is so widespread that you have all become immune to it and the evil which it breathes. My children, you must come to Me and never give up your quest for peace and love. Never think that I will not hear your voices, as they call out to Me, no matter how little you are.
My Son's Second Coming will create great havoc, division, mistrust, hatred and sadness, as the Truth of My Holy Word will be thrown to one side. Satan and his demons have recruited a very large army - an army so big and powerful that it would be beyond belief if you could see how it has been formed. This army controls what you, My children, are being told in public. Very rarely, from now on, will you be told the Truth. By this I mean the Truth, according to My Most Holy Covenant.
All matters relating to the world in which you live will not be truly revealed to you, as wars, deliberately created to destroy My people, will soon be witnessed. None of these wars will be for the good of man nor will they be just. My Word, given to the world, since the first prophet revealed My Desires, will no longer be taken seriously.The Word, according to My Son, Jesus Christ, will be abused and defiled in order to justify lies.
It is time for all those who are called to the service of My Son to remain alert. You cannot ignore this, My Call to humanity. I, through My Son, ask you to stay together, in union with Him at all times. You, My children, are Satan's first target, as he will not rest until he seizes My Son's Church on Earth, first. Without My Son's Church, he will fail to draw the souls he craves the most. You, My children, will be hurt and tormented by the beast - the antichrist - if you cave into pressures which force you to embrace the new false doctrine, which is now being carefully and ruthlessly prepared.
I, the Father of all of you, God the Most High, wish it to be made known that the antichrist is about to be embraced by My enemies in secret rituals. He is being sworn in behind hidden walls, in places, which are meant for the Adoration of My Son. The ecclesiastical masonry, which will now be witnessed, plays an important role in this abomination. Sadly, all of this must take place before My Covenant to gather all My children, back into the Paradise I created for them, in the first instance, is completed.
It will be up to those of you, chosen by Me, to always acknowledge the Truth, so that you can help My Son to save the other souls who will swear an oath to follow the beast.
My Son's Image, common throughout the world, will soon be replaced by the image of the false prophet. His image will be adored first, instead of that of My Son. Then this will be followed by large images, in every kind of format, of the beast, whose sign 666 will be embedded within every single mark he makes upon an unsuspecting world. You will see this sign hidden in such wicked objects, which will be used just as one would carry holy objects. A form of rosary beads will be created to idolise the new, soon to be declared, union of the world's churches. The new world religion will be celebrated by the taking of holy prayer books, medals, scapulars, rosary beads, Crosses and desecrating them into becoming good luck charms.
Everyone will love the antichrist, as he will represent the world outside of religion, on the one hand, but because he will be embraced by the false imposter in My Son's Church on Earth, he will be seen to represent all that is sacred in the world.
My children, do not let news of these events tear at your heart, for when you listen to Me, and follow the Path of My Son, I will spare you much of the persecution of spirit, which is to come. Your adherence to these Messages will be weakened from time to time, by attacks planted by Satan. Some of you will walk away. Some of you will doubt. The vast majority of you will remain true to Me and I will grant you great Favours and Graces for your obedience.
I love you children. I will be merciful and when you ask Me, through My Son, to soothe your hearts and help you to remain at peace and walk with confidence towards the Gates of My New Paradise, I will answer your call.
Your loving Father God the Most High

Relax, all of you, and know that God is ever Powerful and that no act, however evil, cannot be trampled on by Him
Friday, October 11th, 2013 @ 22:30

My dearly beloved daughter, know that I walk beside you every day, every minute, awaiting your response. There are times when you have too much to do for this Mission, but you must always leave the proper time aside for Me, your Jesus. Remember I Am always Present and respond always to those who call out to Me. Nothing must ever separate you from My Company because the time you yield to Me grants you great Graces.
Today I ask that all those who accept that I now speak to the whole world, through the Book of Truth, to prepare yourselves. Never allow My Messages to cause you concern, worry or panic. Never believe that I would ask you to run from your homes into refuges, for this command does not come from Me. The refuges I speak of are those places you need to go to in order to receive Mass and the Sacraments.
My loyal servants are preparing now, all over the world, for that day to come when the daily Sacrifice of the Mass will be no more.

You must always keep the Blessed Seal of the Living God in your homes and in whatever format you can, in order to carry it with you also. This will protect you from any kind of persecution and you will gain the strength necessary to remain true to God and everything, which is laid down clearly in the Most Holy Bible.
Relax, all of you, and know that God is ever powerful and that no act, however evil, cannot be trampled on by Him.

Those of you who choose to respond to My Call are blessed. You, in turn, through your act of love for your neighbor, will spread the Seal of the Living God everywhere you go. Now you must do this. Trust in Me. Never feel restless, for I do not spread fear. I spread the Truth, which for some can be overwhelming. I Am your Protector, your Saviour, and I will come soon to bring you the final salvation and the world to come, which will have no evil. Be at peace. I will guide and protect you all and give you the Gift of perseverance in all the trials ahead.
Your Jesus

Once the Heavens and Earth become one, there will be no Purgatory
Saturday, October 12th, 2013 @ 17:10

My dearly beloved daughter, My Throne will be placed upon the renewed Earth and soon all will live in peace and harmony, in accordance with the Will of My Father.
The world will become as it was in the beginning and no discord will be felt. All of God's children, who are chosen to join with the angels and saints, will live a perfect existence. But know this. Those who do not accept the reality of the New Paradise, when they have been given every chance to decide which path they wish to choose, will not be given a second chance. Once the Heavens and Earth become one, there will be no Purgatory. The only path souls will take, who refuse to accept My Mercy when it is handed to them freely, will be the one which leads to Hell. Many will be so stubborn, because they rely almost completely on intellectual reasoning, that they will, unwittingly, choose to spend eternity in the fires of Hell.
Those who do not believe in God, or accept the Truth, do not believe in the existence of Satan. He, the deceiver, will cloud their minds with lies, so as to entice them into the chambers of torture. Once there, because of his hatred of man, he will make them suffer non-stop for eternity. I cannot help these souls then. How I weep with bitter sorrow for the souls of the arrogant, the ignorant and those with hardened hearts. They are so stuffed with pride, that they will never see Me because they can't. It is not possible for a person to see Me or to be filled with My True Word, if they are stricken with the sin of pride.
Those of you, on the other hand, who know Me, but who accept Me on your own terms - you too distance yourselves from Me.

Why do you say you know Me and then twist what I told you about following Me? How can you call yourself a Christian and be prepared to accept false theology and lies, which you have twisted to suit your own lifestyles? Who are you if you do not follow Me and accept the full Truth of My Teachings? You are a traitor. You betray Me. When you betray Me once, you will be tempted to do it again and again, until finally, you will no longer be a Christian in My Eyes.
I must call on all those who believe in My Word and ask you, when have I ever condoned sin? I forgive sin, but I never condone it. If you believe that I condone sin, then you justify sin. You will suffer for the error of your ways and you are no better than those who betrayed Me, mocked Me, laughed at Me and crucified Me.
Remember, I taught you the Truth. Nothing but the Truth will bring you to accept the salvation I now come to bring to the world, at this, the final stage of My Covenant to save humanity.
Never forget that I Am the Truth. Only the Truth comes from Me. Your Jesus

You do not know Me because you do not recognise Me
Sunday, October 13th, 2013 @ 18:00

My dearly beloved daughter, when those of you feel abandoned and unsure of My Love for the world, you must never give up calling out to Me to help you. You will, from time to time, feel a sense of hopelessness, a sense of fear and a sense of loneliness when you adhere to My Holy Word, given to the world through the Holy Gospel. Even now, as My Holy Gospel is still presented to you, you will feel very isolated, because few people put into practice what I have taught them through My Holy Word.
If you say you love your neighbour and then slander him, you will still belong to Me. If you say that you believe in the Ten Commandments, but adapt them to suit your lifestyles, then you are blind to the Truth. If you accept the Sacraments given to you through Me, but break them, you insult Me. When you preach My Holy Word to others and then place yourself before others, by saying that you are more worthy than them, in the Eyes of God, you offend Me. When you declare the Word of God to no longer matter in a modern world and that it must be adapted to appeal to a secular world, then you spit in the Face of God. When you believe that your knowledge of Me is superior to My Holy Word, as I give it to you now through these Messages and that there is error contained within them, you are ignorant of the Truth. You do not know Me because you do not recognise Me.
So, even those of you who feel content with your understanding of My Holy Word and reject Me now in this Mission - you have abandoned Me. You, especially, must call out for My Help for you are nothing without Me.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: To the priests in the Catholic Church, I urge you to carry my Most Holy Rosary beads
Monday, October 14th, 2013 @ 15:30

My dear child, do not believe for one moment, that any of you are strong enough, on your own, to withstand the temptations you will face to turn your back on the Truth - the True Word of God. Without continuous prayers, you will find that you will be unable to stand up and declare the Truth when you are presented with lies.
All of you must recite the Crusade Prayers as the darkness has already begun to descend over my Son's Church on Earth and you must be prepared for this every second.
To the priests in the Catholic Church, I urge you to carry my Most Holy Rosary beads and a Benedictine Cross with you at all times. You must recite my Holy Rosary every single day and watch out for those in the higher ranks within the Church to see who recites my Holy Rosary in public. When I am being venerated, my Holy Rosary must be recited by all present before me. If they, who say, lead the faithful to seek my assistance before the Throne of God, cannot recite my Rosary, then they need your prayers. To come before me, seeking my help, without reciting my Rosary, is without substance, as it is akin to a soldier going into battle without any armour.
My Rosary is the most powerful prayer and, when said daily, will destroy the power of the evil one. Those, whose souls have been darkened by Satan, will find it too painful to recite this prayer. By their actions you will know who they are and you must ask God, through the Mercy of my Son, Jesus Christ, to help them to draw towards the Light of God.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

The plans have been drawn up by the unholy trinity where all that is True will be banished
Tuesday, October 15th, 2013 @ 15:45

My dearly beloved daughter, it is My desire that all of My priests, in every Christian denomination, begin to preserve the Most Holy Sacraments. Those in the Catholic Church will be the first to witness the destruction and desecration of the Sacraments. Those who are loyal to Me, Jesus Christ, will prepare diligently for this terrible wilderness into which My Church will be plunged. You must prepare now, because it will be through your allegiance that all of God's children will be able to receive the Sacraments in their holy state.
To all other Christian churches I say this. Remind yourselves of My Promise to come again on the Great and Glorious Day of My Second Coming. Know too, that in the years leading up to this, that all those who follow Me will face terrible trials. Those who will succeed to new positions of power, within all your denominations, will be led by the false prophet and all will mouth his words and copy his actions.
Woe to those who side with the false prophet for he is the antithesis of John the Baptist and will be the precursor of the antichrist who will rule over all of you.
You will be protected by Me, for soon I will be all you have to guide you. Only I can be trusted to tell you the Truth when you will be swayed by the heresies, which will be presented to you as the new form of modern Christian theology. How cunning is Satan, for he will never shock - instead he will, through those who serve him - draw you towards a new twisted, back-to-front interpretation of My Most Holy Word.
The plans have been drawn up, by the unholy trinity, where all that is True will be banished. All that appeals to the secular world, when human greed and desire to ignore sin, will be presented, through all Christian Churches, to the faithful. This day has been written in stone and will be the final insult, allowed by God, before He sends Me, His only Son, to gather all those who remain true to the Word of God. When the lies are presented to you, they will appear to be a good thing. The badge of humility will be common in all of your churches, as it will be adopted by those among them who will deceive you.
Every trait, associated with Me - My Love for the impoverished; My Love for the weak and humble; My disapproval of greed, avarice and lust, will be used as part of the arguments used to force you to accept this new doctrine - this new one world religion, to prepare the world for the rule of the antichrist.
As a loving God, you are being given these warnings in order to save you. Heed Me now. All I ask is one thing. Remain true to My Holy Word. My Holy Word was given to you, in the Holy Bible. It can never change. But the enemies of God will twist its meanings. When this happens, reject those who tell you that God would approve of such changes. Nothing could be further from the Truth.
Your Jesus

The serpent gives the antichrist special messages, which he documents carefully
Wednesday, October 16th, 2013 @ 23:27

My dearly beloved daughter, the most unholy trinity, consisting of My three enemies, the false prophet, the antichrist and the dragon, that is Satan, will rise now in defiance against the Most Holy Trinity. Know that they have many thousands and thousands of devout disciples and as the time draws near, many secret and vile ceremonies will take place to honour the serpent.
So careful is the serpent not to reveal his true self, his real wicked intentions against any child of God are disguised, and he presents himself to his elect chosen few as a charming, beautiful prince, where he manifests before them in the most seductive manner. Just as My Own chosen prophets are communicated with, the serpent gives the antichrist special messages, which he documents carefully and then shares with his hierarchy on Earth. These messages contain instructions to desecrate My Church, in preparation for the antichrist to take up his throne and fool the world into believing he is the Christ, the Saviour of the World.
Heed now, all of you who dismiss this warning. Soon, many of My disciples, who love Me, but who do not believe in these Messages, will face great danger. The plan to take you away from Me has begun, and unless you remain cautious and alert, you will be enticed into the den of darkness. He, the antichrist, will emulate every aspect of My Divinity, made known to him by the serpent. He, the serpent, watched My Crucifixion and only he has the knowledge of the details, which surrounded this terrible event. He will mock Me by instructing his devoted servants into re-constructing rituals, back to front, in My Church. My Word will be taken and new obscene parts will be added to It, in order to honour the beast, and many will not understand the significance.
Dabble with the devil and place yourself at his disposal and this will lead to great trials. Repeat the vile words he will plant amongst you and you will open your soul to him. Adore him, by loving the antichrist when he struts arrogantly before you and you will place him in your hearts, instead of Me. All I have taught you will be back to front, upside down and inside out. Because so many do not truly understand My Teachings and because so few of you have listened carefully to the Gospels, with regard to the events leading up to My Second Coming, you will be none the wiser.
Oh how My Heart breaks to have to reveal this news. How I wish you did not have to suffer like this. But, I promise, I will ease your pain and his reign ,when it takes place, will be swift.
The souls who are innocently caught up in this travesty of My Divinity will be shown My Mercy. Sadly, those who believe they will reign in a paradise, promised to them by the deceiver, will find themselves thrown into the lake of fire where they will suffer for eternity. There will be no one to help them, for they will have swallowed the lies, designed to gain their trust, which will result in loss of many souls who will follow their false doctrine blindly.
Pray for Mercy for those who will be deceived by the king of darkness. Your Jesus

Every new law, soon to be introduced by enemies within My Church, will mock the Truth laid down by My Father
Thursday, October 17th, 2013 @ 20:38

My dearly beloved daughter, if only more people would believe truly in Me, their Jesus, then they would find peace in their hearts. Where there is no trust, there is fear. Fear prevents the Love of God from penetrating your soul and then you become a prisoner. Nothing, only My Light, will lift the burden.
When I tell you the Truth, I do this only because I love you and yearn for the day when we will be united, finally. Do not fear the Truth. My Love will fill you with the courage and the strength to stand firm and remain true to Me in all things. I protect all of those of you who ask Me, but it is only the souls who abandon themselves fully to Me, who will have no fear.
The wickedness of the beast will be disguised as charming and modern and it will be revealed to all behind the veneer of humanitarianism, charity and 'care for the poor'. Do not believe, for one minute, that Satan's disciples will ever show you their true colours. Every lie presented, to replace the Truth, will appear to be logical and for the common good of all. Every new law, soon to be introduced by enemies within My Church, will mock the Truth laid down by My Father in the Ten Commandments, given to Moses. Every gesture, subtle though it may be, will be designed to insult Me, Jesus Christ, the Son of Man. The deceiver, through his servants, cannot resist mocking Me, for he hates Me. He will insult every vessel in My Church through actions, words and the addition of Satanic symbols. Only those who know the Truth will see these abominations and understand exactly what such gestures really mean.
The power of Satan can confuse, distract and torment My disciples. He, Satan, will never leave you alone, especially when you bear witness to the Truth. But know this - he can be overcome when you trust in Me completely. When you abandon yourselves before Me, he will not be given the power to influence your faith in Me. He, Satan, is finished. His reign, painful though it was for humanity, is at an end. His final insult before Me will be carried out through the antichrist, who will imitate Me and fool the world into believing that he is Me, Jesus Christ, and that he has come to save the world.
When you know the Truth, you will be able to withstand this temptation. When you remain firm to the Truth, contained in the Most Holy Bible, you will be saved.
The final attack will be swift and then I will show the world the Truth and only those who are full of hatred for Me will deny it. Do not fear, for I Am the only Saviour of humanity. Only My Love will sustain you. Fear only for those poor souls who will spit at Me as I reach out, finally, to take them into the New Paradise.
Your Jesus

I may be their only true friend, their only salvation, but many of them will ignore My Warnings
Friday, October 18th, 2013 @ 12:38

My dearly beloved daughter, My greatest sadness is that those who love Me the most, in their masses, will refuse to hear My Voice, now as I call out to them.
I may be their only true friend, their only salvation, but many of them will ignore My Warnings. Even those who hear My Voice will ignore Me and dismiss My Words as heresy. They will not recognise the times they live in and will only realise the Truth during The Warning. By then, many of them will have cursed Me and removed themselves so far beyond Me that I will not be able to reach into their hearts or save their souls.
Do not underestimate the hatred which the devil has for Me. He betrayed My Father terribly, but he detests Me. This means that he hates My Church and it will be between My Church on Earth and the demons sent by Satan that the final battle will take place. This battle has commenced and has already stolen My beloved souls, many of whom have failed to see how they offend God.
When My Presence is felt soon, amongst all those who love Me - irrespective of whether they believe in these Messages or not - I will flood their souls with knowledge by the Power of the Holy Spirit. That is My Promise to the world. I will never forsake you to the power of evil, for I love you all so much. You are like a Limb from My Body. You are part of My Body. You are Part of Me.
Whether you want Me to or not, I will follow you until the Great Day and I will fight to save your soul. You may turn your back on Me, but I will not forsake you, for I Am patient. My Perseverance and Divinity are beyond your knowing. You must never forget Me, Your Jesus, for I Am with you always, waiting for you to come to Me.
Your beloved Saviour Redeemer of Mankind Jesus Christ

The antichrist will create grants to entice companies, organisations, as well as charities, to work for his new one world trade centre
Saturday, October 19th, 2013 @ 20:00

My dearly beloved daughter, I call on all of My disciples who have heard Me and who recognise Me, in these Messages, to listen to Me now.
This Work, which has been bestowed upon you, is Sacred. Whatever torment, abuse, suffering and ridicule you may endure, because of this Mission, remember that this Work is Mine. My final Mission, given to the world, through God's prophet, is a great Gift to humanity. Rise above the mockery, which you will witness and know that it is created by the evil one in an effort to stop the Truth. The Truth, My Holy Word, will be trampled on and every demon, released from the depths of Hell, will do everything possible to silence My Voice.
Working through those souls, who leave themselves open to infestation, the evil works of Satan will soon be camouflaged and presented to the world as Holy Scripture. The new doctrine, they will say, was divinely inspired by Me, Jesus Christ. The whole world will be brought to attention, as it is unveiled layer by layer and applauded, especially, by a secular world. Those who you would never expect to give honour to God will be the first in the queue to embrace the series of heresies - lies against Me - as they are revealed.
Never before will the Catholic Church receive such public honour with the world's media and political elite. Never before will atheists and all religions, including those who do not honour Me, open their arms and drop to their knees in honour of those who say that they are of God.
When My Image disappears and is no longer seen and when My Crosses, Holy Bibles, misselettes for the Holy Mass, rosary beads, medals, scapulars and Benedictine Crosses are no longer to be found, you will know then that the reign of the beast has commenced.
The world will sing the praises of the antichrist. No sooner will he have created peace - a false peace - created because of wars he helped to start - than he will make startling statements. He, the antichrist, will declare that he has received messages from God the Father and they will seem to be authentic. Then, using the power of the occult, he will be seen to heal many and appear to have great spiritual gifts. Many will be astonished by the 'so-called' miracles he will seem to perform and the world will adore him and lay prostrate at his feet. Then he, the antichrist, will declare himself to be Jesus Christ, the Son of man, and say that the time has come for him to reclaim the world and salvage the whole of
humanity. Anyone who dares to challenge the filth and obscenities, which will pour from the mouth of the beast, will be punished severely.
At this time, because of the infestation of Satan in the world, sin will be so widespread that human dignity will reach its lowest levels, where impurity, lust, greed and every other vile sin, in the Eyes of God, will be witnessed in every public place. Because sin will be declared to be a natural human fault, and because you will be told that God will not judge you on a weak human trait, many will embrace sin and have no shame in their souls.
The world's celebrities, entertainers, media, movie stars will all clamour to be seen with the antichrist and his image will be more visible than anyone who came before him. He will be fluent in many languages; he will be handsome; have a great sense of humour and extraordinary communications skills. He will be very careful as to what he says about God and he will never refer to the Mother of God, for she will be seen to have no further role to play.
The antichrist's interviews on television will be common and people will hang onto every word, which comes out of his mouth. He will influence politicians in every nation and those with whom he is seen will be treated like royalty. It will not end there. His quotes will be preached upon the pulpits of all churches. He will be given great honour and position in all churches, until eventually he will sit on the new throne in the new temple of Babylon. His influence will extend to all the banks, trading laws and the world's economy. The antichrist will create grants to entice companies, organisations, as well as charities, to work for his new one world trade centre. Great wealth will be created by those who want to be part of the antichrist's empire. Everyone who swears allegiance to him, either through religious ceremonies, business or trade agreements, will have to take a mark. Those who accept the mark, which will be in the form of a bank card and special chip, which will be embedded into their hand, will lose their souls to him. All those who wear the Seal of the Living God will escape the clutches of the antichrist and become immune to the horror. Do not ignore this warning. Do not fear it, for if you follow My instructions, you will be protected.
I spilt many Tears giving you this Message and this is why My Pain in you, My daughter, at this time is so great. Comfort Me by calling on My Mercy and for My Protection.
Your Jesus

You must remain calm, at peace, but with a firm resolve to continue to proclaim the Holy Word contained in the Gospels
Sunday, October 20th, 2013 @ 12:07

My dearly beloved daughter, I desire to reveal to all of you, My beloved apostles - those who walk the Earth and who proclaim My Holy Word - that you must cling to Me, your Jesus, like never before. These times, which lie ahead of you will be difficult and to all those who remain in Me, with Me and for Me, you will be responsible for keeping the Flame of My Light aglow in the dark days ahead.
My precious children, you must remain calm, at peace, but with a firm resolve to continue to proclaim the Holy Word contained in the Gospels in every corner of the world. You, My Remnant Army, will bring all of God's children to Me and help to save them from the vapor of evil, which will envelop millions of souls. You are Mine and you walk within the Light of God, paving the way for the world to be saved.
My Graces are being poured down upon you, My beloved apostles, and once you know that you are being guided by Me and trust in Me completely, no harm will come to you. But should you allow yourselves to become willing servants of deceit, then My Protection will not cover you. Those of you who side with the false prophet and the antichrist will be ensnared by Satan and he will not let you go free. Those of you who walk alongside My enemies and swallow the chalice of the serpent will be destroyed by him should you dare to challenge him.
Heed now, My warning - side with the beast and swear an unholy oath to honour heresy and you will find it very difficult to prise yourselves away from his vile grip. Pray that you will have the wisdom to see the Truth.
Your Jesus

They will follow like lambs to the slaughter, the road to destruction
Monday, October 21st, 2013 @ 10:56

My dearly beloved daughter, the greatest betrayal of My beloved, loyal disciples - those who will always hold firm to the Truth - will be by those followers in My Church who will fall prey to the great deceit.
So many people, because of their misguided loyalty, will be deceived by the imposter who will seize the reins in My Churches everywhere. Though they may feel uneasy at times, when they hear strange renditions of My Holy Word, which will not be taken in the correct context, they will follow like lambs to the slaughter, the road to destruction. They will lavish praise upon the false prophet and salute him like a great dictator and they will become as one to create a large army. This army will cause the greatest persecution upon their fellow Christians. Brother will fight brother in this terrible battle for the Truth. The number of those who will follow the unholy trinity, comprised of the false prophet, the antichrist and Satan, will be much greater than those who remain true to the Holy Word of God as it was laid down from the beginning.
You, My chosen people, who do not deviate from the Truth, will find this journey difficult. Never, for one moment in your lives, would you have imagined the terrible deceit, which you are about to witness. My enemies are well-prepared, have much influence and are well funded. They have many advantages, but they have not got, on their side, the Power of God. Not only do they not possess the Power of God, My Father, the Almighty One, but they can be struck down at any time by His Will. Sadly, they will draw many souls away from Me and I will allow this as part of the final purification of mankind. This period on Earth will be to separate the good from the wicked.
What do I mean by this? Surely, you will say, the good will be fooled and that this is not their fault. This is true. But, when those who say they are true Christians, accept heresy, instead of My Holy Word, they blaspheme against Me. They are well-aware of the Truth and they must be alert to My Word every second. So many of you are asleep. So many do not truly know Me, because you have no humility in your soul, so proud are you of your knowledge of Holy Scripture. Many of you have failed to read the Gospels or understand what will happen before My Second Coming. You still do not know, yet, that the Truth was given to you, in the Most Holy Bible. Why do you continue to defy the Word of God, argue, reject and fight against the Hand which created you? You are no more informed than those who crucified Me. You have no more knowledge than the Pharisees who believed that their interpretation of the Holy Word of God was superior to that of the Son of man. Because of your refusal to accept the final prophecies, you will deny Me. All your services to Me will mean nothing, for you will follow the one sent by Satan to deny you your rightful inheritance in My Paradise.
How you make Me weep. How you will betray Me will be reflected in the persecution which you will bring to bear on those you call your brothers and sisters, in My Name. You will become indoctrinated with lies, as others before you were, by wicked leaders and dictators of the past. Because of your lack of real love for Me, which requires great sacrifice, you will bring Me much grief and suffering. While the enemies of My Church will draw you into a web of deceit, you will sing their praises, adore and love those who hate Me and I will be forgotten.
Remember these Words. When you place false gods before Me, you will incur the Wrath of God. Your Jesus

All those who wear the triangle, the sign of the most unholy trinity, will be involved in endorsing such charities
Tuesday, October 22nd, 2013 @ 00:20

My dearly beloved daughter, every corner of My Church is being prepared for the new rituals. Public declarations of the need to be humble and caring will set the precedence for the secular philanthropy, which will be introduced by the antichrist. All these servants of Satan are joining in celebrations in private and their worldwide network will create global charities, set up to convince you that they are divinely inspired.
All those who wear the triangle, the sign of the most unholy trinity, will be involved in endorsing such charities, so that it will elevate them in the eyes of the world. Suddenly, a new, powerful and so-called evangelical movement will be talked about and people will hand over their money to help grow their efforts to help the world's poor. Everyone will believe that the greater good is being done and certain leaders in My Churches will be admired in all corners of the Earth. Very few will argue about their intentions, but when you see the world's largest banks join them in their efforts, you will know then that this is an act designed to deceive you. How cunning is the beast. How clever his actions seem to be, because they will be sugar coated with a form of deceit, which only those blessed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit will be able to discern. And during all the talk about the common good of man, the desire to bring all religions together to form one large communion of people - not one word will be uttered about My Teaching that God's children must remain firm to My Holy Word.
The times are moving quickly and amidst this, seemingly well ordered and carefully orchestrated propaganda, the cracks will begin to appear. When Satan is at work, confusion spreads; division is created; contradictions become rampant and nothing is ever orderly. Certain honours, accorded to Me before My Tabernacles, will disappear. Perpetual Adoration hours will be stopped and soon they will strip the Churches of the statues of the saints. All their actions will be condoned in the name of uprooting the Church of old and making it more relevant, more attractive and more appealing to non-believers.
Those who know Me must do all they can, through the spread of the Gospels, because, be assured, you will hear no talk of the Holy Bible. The only quotes you will hear will be those, which are twisted to support lies. As they strip the Church of its dignity, the punishments will begin to pour down upon them from the Heavens. They will, in time, be stopped, but these trials must take place first, as foretold.
Your Jesus

You are the generation, which will have to bear witness to the final Crucifixion of My Church
Tuesday, October 22nd, 2013 @ 13:30

My dearly beloved daughter, My beloved servants will unite in union with Me - less than half of them - but their loyalty to Me will help My Army to survive and grow in order to spread the Gospels during the global darkness which will be felt during this, the greatest apostasy of all time.
The lack of respect for Me, Jesus Christ, is becoming evident in all nations, in public places and in My Churches. My desire now is to prepare My Army properly. Do not, My beloved followers, let these things disturb you, for they will only distract you when I need you to be strong in your faith. Just as doors were slammed in My Mother's face, as she tried to seek shelter, just before My Birth, so too will doors be shut in your faces. Know that when these doors are being slammed in your faces by those misguided servants in My Church, you must only turn to Me then. Know also that those who claim to be holy people, knowledgeable in Holy Scripture and the Teachings of My Church, will queue up and be the first to condemn you, because you are following the Truth. I refer to all souls in the world who love Me and who know the Truth and not, necessarily, those who follow these My Messages for the whole world.
The Gift of the Holy Spirit will fall only upon those worthy to receive this precious Gift from God. Those empty of the Holy Spirit will scream abuse and try to convince you to follow the heresies, which will soon become rampant in all Christian churches. The more they show their fear for these Messages, the more they will strike out at you. You must ignore their hateful venom and remain silent. These days are almost upon you. Some of you will already have glimpsed the severe opposition, which you will have to endure because of Me.
You are the generation, which will have to bear witness to the final Crucifixion of My Church, but know this. Out of the ashes will rise My Glorious Body, the New Jerusalem and you will be chosen to reign amongst the twelve nations. When you remain true to Me, I will raise you in glory and Heaven and Earth will be yours, in the world to come. You must remain fixed on Me only, during the desolation of abomination, for it will be short. And then, nothing will ever separate you from Me again.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: My Son is planning a great renewal on Earth, at this time, and it will cause much pain
Wednesday, October 23rd, 2013 @ 15:34

My child, I cover all of my children, at this time, with my protection, so that they will remain calm, at peace and strong at these times of great trials.
You must, dear children, accept the fact that you will always feel pain, caused by the isolation, rejection and dismissal by those who scorn the Word of God. Light attracts those who are in the dark and they will always attack and lash out against you, when you are in full union with my Son, Jesus Christ.
My Son is planning a great renewal on Earth, at this time, and it will cause much pain, because it takes the form of a purification. This means that many will suffer for their sins now and that the Earth is being prepared for Jesus Christ, so that when the purification is complete, the announcement will be made. The enemies of God will, meanwhile, spread lies and heresies to win over sinners and all those who love my Son, in order to control them. All these sad events must take place before the Second Coming of my Son, Jesus Christ.
I ask you, dear children, to be patient and to endure these difficulties, for the sake of my Son, Who loves you dearly. Never feel anxious, because you will soon witness His New Paradise where no sadness, pain or evil will exist. It is such a little thing when you suffer for my Son and it is insignificant when compared to what He endured for each and every one of you when He died on the Cross to save you.
So please place all your trust in my Son and be thankful that you are being sent guidance from Heaven. Rejoice because you have been given the correct amount of time to prepare properly for the Great Day of the Lord.
Be at peace.

Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

God the Father: This is a Call for the salvation of those of you who will not question the heresies about to be declared
Thursday, October 24th, 2013 @ 19:45

My dearest daughter, I come to tell the world that the enemies who roam the Earth, in the guise of those who say they bring the Word of My Son to the masses, have now joined as one. As one, they bring all their powers together and will deface the Earth with their wicked deceit.
I Am ready. Waiting. As soon as they introduce their vile laws, I will strike out and the world will witness My punishments. My Warnings have fallen on deaf ears and those too proud to accept the Hand of Mercy, given to you through My Messages. The leaders of those who will persecute you, in the name of human rights, will suffer by My Hand. They believe that their power is almighty and that they are invincible, but they will know soon that they are nothing without the Power of their Creator.
I Am the Author of Life, and should those who decide to use their power to take away the lives of My children, in both body and soul, they will lose everything. When you fight My children and betray My Son, Jesus Christ, there is little hope for you. I do not bestow My Mercy on you easily, for you cause Me great Anger. Yet I crave your loyalty but warn you of the dangers of dallying with the evil one. I will give you every chance, to turn away from the shackles, which bind you to the unholy trinity. You must remove yourselves from the chains of Satan. Your time is short.
I ask you to look to My Holy Bible, the Gospels, and seek out the signs you were given about the great apostasy foretold, for it has engulfed the world and spreads like a deadly virus into every conceivable part of your society. You have been infested and now I Come, Your Father, to cleanse you of this terrible affliction. You must beg Me for help, before it is too late for you.
You must now recite this Crusade Prayer. Ask Me for help.

Crusade Prayer (124) Hear my plea for freedom

O God, my Merciful Father, Creator of all that is, hear my plea for freedom. Release me from the chains of slavery and protect me from evil persecution. Help me to discern the Truth and come to my aid, even if I am confused and may doubt Your Word. Forgive me if I offend You and take me into the refuge of Your New Paradise on Earth. Amen.
My Time, to declare the Second Coming of My Son is close. Time will move swiftly and the reign of My enemies, short-lived though it may be, will seem like an eternity, because of the cruelty they will show to My children. They will show no loyalty, whatsoever, to those foolish men, who will swear allegiance to the beast. Just as the evil one hates Me, so he hates any of My children, both the good and the wicked. This is a Call for the salvation of those of you who will not question the heresies about to be declared. You must question and question any doubts, which invade your souls, when you are unhappy with any new form of doctrine, which does not feel right in your hearts.
I have not given the authority for any new law or sacrament, to be introduced in My Most Holy Name.

Your beloved Father God the Most High

Very few people in the world today have any faith or belief in God
Friday, October 25th, 2013 @ 23:55

My dearly beloved daughter, when people accuse you of spreading fear, through these Messages, then they must understand My true intention. Fear comes from the wickedness of those who are infused with darkness of the soul, who walk amongst you. Your enemies are My enemies. They will create such false spirituality in every nation and it will not come from Me. So charming will they be, they will be infiltrated amongst those with high profiles in order to spread the false doctrine of new age, satanic origins. Many will consider these terrible actions to be harmless fun, but behind the seemingly innocent façade lies a cunning plan to rid the world of its belief in the Holy Trinity.
Very few people in the world today have any faith or belief in God and so when the servants of Satan present them with false values, false spirituality and paganism, many will be seduced. They will be attracted to the false, charitable appeals for the rights of those who seek acceptance for their own lives, which defy the Laws laid down by My Father. Because their faith in God is weak, they will be open to lies. They will adore a false god, the antichrist, instead.
I tell you these things, for they are the Truth. Why would I not warn you of these things? I Am your Saviour and I Am preparing to salvage you all, finally, after this prolonged and painful time. Man has suffered untold hardship because of Satan. So many people do not understand how much he destroys lives. He wrecks your relationships with other people, attracts you to vices, which destroy you, changes you and entraps you. No matter what he gives you, you will always feel empty. You will keep falling and falling until you become involved with depraved and unnatural acts and you will find no satisfaction. Only, I Jesus Christ, can bring you true peace, love and salvation. As your life on Earth will be changed beyond your comprehension, by the antichrist, I have to warn you.I do this, not to bring you fear, but to prepare you for the Truth.
Only the Truth will free you from the wickedness of those who live, breathe and who will die because of their allegiance to Satan and his demons.
Only I, Jesus, Am your Way to seek relief from the persecution, which these wicked, cunning and deceitful people will bring to bear on the world.
Your Jesus

The Great Day will dawn and soon the world without end will begin
Saturday, October 26th, 2013 @ 11:15

My dearly beloved daughter, the faith of all God's children, irrespective of which denomination they belong to, is so weak that many of those who know the Truth will find it very difficult to practice their religion openly, without criticism.
So many in the world reject Me, Jesus Christ, at this time in history, that it is no longer acceptable, in most nations, to speak of Me in public. Very seldom will you hear My Name being spoken about in the media, unless it is to question My Existence. Seldom will you hear people openly proclaim their love for Me in public, for they would find this too embarrassing.
Even those sacred servants of Mine are no longer willing to declare the Truth for fear of ridicule. Those who do follow Me will find it increasingly difficult to proclaim My Holy Word. So many, who once loved Me, no longer do so and My desolation and sadness cuts My Heart, as if a sword was driven through it.
Why, oh why, have you deserted Me? Why do those of you who believe in Me and who know Me, hurt so many of your brothers and sisters? Why does hate thrive in your hearts? Why do you feel the need to question the Gospels now, when they have existed for so long? Who gave you the authority to misinterpret My Word given to My apostles? Why are you twisting them and why do you not believe what I said? My Word is very clear. When I speak, I mean what I say. If I say one thing, I do not mean another. Why would I, for example, contradict Myself and especially now in this Mission?
What is given to God's prophets is the Truth. Anything which contradicts these Messages, from the mouths of those who claim that I speak with them, must be rejected by you. I would never compete with My Own Voice, because I must ensure that you are given the Truth.
What must I do to make you listen? What must I do to stop your wandering and seeking out other forms of titillation? Why will you not trust in Me? You waste so much precious time seeking out fortune telling, which flows like venom out of the mouths of so- called mystics and sensation seekers, that you insult Me by turning away from Me. I Am here. These are My Words. What else do you seek, for you will only find the Truth from My Mouth? I spoke the Truth when I walked the Earth. I left a legacy of great hope and salvation. I speak the Truth now, as I bring you My Final Words, at this time, for the Great Day will dawn and soon the world without end will begin.
When I speak, I desire that you listen. I cannot force you. You may look everywhere and try to find My Messages, given to prepare the world for My Second Coming at this time, and you won't find them. My public Messages to prepare you for this, the final stage before My Covenant is fulfilled, can only be found in the Book of Truth.
The Word is Mine. My Words will be heard in every nation. No one will stop Me, for My Power is Almighty. Your Jesus

My Church was built upon the Truth and nothing but the Truth should spill from her lips
Sunday, October 27th, 2013 @ 23:30

My dearly beloved daughter, when My Church is applauded openly by a proud and secular world, know then that the two separate entities are close to joining as one. When My Church embraces the secular world, becomes politically motivated by it, and seeks recognition in the world of politics and business, know then, that I would never condone such action.
My Church was built upon My Word. My Church was built upon the Truth and nothing but the Truth should spill from her lips. When My Church speaks, with My Authority, against sin, it will always suffer criticism, for man will always defend sin. Sin makes his life more acceptable to him and others and he will make every effort to declare Hell to be nonsense. When My Church speaks only of this world, its woes, its problems, the suffering of man and does not preach the Word of God, it separates itself from Me. Only those within the Church who remain loyal to what I taught them can truly say that they belong to My Church. My Church consists only of those who speak the Truth.
When those within My Church dismiss Me, Jesus Christ, then the spirit of evil has entered its domain. I Am being squeezed out of My Church. I Am no longer revered as I once was. My Own Words are no longer used to declare the Truth. They are being twisted to condone words, deeds and actions, which do not come from Me, nor will they ever come from Me. My Word can never be changed and any man who takes My Word and defiles it will suffer eternal punishment.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: My Son's Church will become the seat of the antichrist
Tuesday, October 29th, 2013 @ 19:30

My sweet child, the Heavens all join, in union with my Son, to come to the aid of those holy priests, who will find themselves in the middle of a great battle. So many of these precious souls will have to endure terrible pain and suffering when they will have to witness the heresies, which will spring from within the Church. They will be confused, frightened and many will feel that they have nowhere to turn. This is when they must turn to me, ask me to Consecrate them to my Son, so that He can pour over them every drop of His Precious Blood. When covered with this Gift, they will know what to do. They must know that I have warned my children, all down through the centuries, of this wicked apostasy, which is being planned by the evil one.
My Son's Church will become the seat of the antichrist and now that the Truth has been revealed, many will feel frightened and will suffer the pain of my Son's Scourging. My Son's Church will be persecuted, destroyed, desecrated - until eventually, it will house the throne upon which will sit the antichrist. It will be from here that he, the antichrist, will declare that he is the Christ and that the world will be saved through him.
By accepting lies, you deny the Truth. By ignoring the Truth, you will believe in a fabricated web of deceit, spun by the evil one and this will entrap you. Once entrapped, you will be tempted to follow the crowds, in every nation, who will pay great respect to the antichrist. Please, children, recite this Crusade Prayer to fight the heresy, which will cover my Son's Church on Earth.
Crusade Prayer (125) To defend the Most Holy Word of God

O Mother of Salvation, help me, a humble servant of God, to defend His Most Holy Word in times of torment. Consecrate me, dear Mother, to your Son, so that He can cover me with His Precious Blood. Grant me, through the Intercession of your Son, Jesus Christ, the grace, the strength and the will to remain true to the Teachings of Christ in the times of Tribulation, which will devour His Most Holy Church on Earth. Amen.
Go to my Son, dear servants of Christ. You belong to Him. He will help you during the persecution. He will never desert you in your time of need.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

Once the Holy Spirit engulfs a soul, it will rise, draw immediately towards the Will of My Father and respond in total abandonment
Wednesday, October 30th, 2013 @ 18:00

My dearly beloved daughter, when My Holy Spirit descends upon a person, a number of things happen. The first is a feeling of bewilderment and disbelief. The second is the sense of being overwhelmed by something so powerful that it renders the person completely dependent upon the Holy Will of God. Gone will be the belief in one's own superior human intellect, for intellect has no longer any meaningful role to play. Instead, the soul will be infused with knowledge, an insight and an understanding that is beyond their own frail human interpretation.
Once the Holy Spirit engulfs a soul, it will rise, draw immediately towards the Will of My Father and respond in total abandonment. Once the initial fear has subsided, a deep peace will be felt and the person's fear of being seen to proclaim the Word of God will disappear. They will not care what people's views are for out of their mouths will pour the Truth. The soul's personality, whether they are outgoing, timid or shy, will take a back seat and will become secondary to the way in which they proclaim the Word of God.
All souls, who receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit - without any exception - will surrender their own free will to the Will of My Father. For souls who have truly been blessed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit, their role will be to spread the Word of God and for this, they will suffer. The Sheath of God's Love, however, covers such souls as they march forth, without fear and with courage to proclaim the Truth. Those who proclaim the Truth of My Teachings, in these times of paganism and when My Church will fall away from the True Faith, will be given extra strength to ensure that My Voice is heard. That strength will come from God, My beloved Father. It will be by the Power of the Strength of God that many of Satan's army will convert, while the remainder will be destroyed.
The Holy Spirit, like swords of burning flames, will cut through the hearts of all those who listen and who accept the Truth.
Your Jesus

When you lack humility, pride will flood your souls and you will sin against Me
Thursday, October 31st, 2013 @ 23:30

My dearly beloved daughter, so many will not listen to My Voice, because they do not know Who I Am. Many claim to know Me, but it is only by their flawed human interpretation that they are convinced that they understand Who I Am and what I did to save them from the abyss, which faces all God's children, who will not ask Me to forgive them.
Free will is a Gift from My Father. Free will can, however, interfere with man's quest to seek the Love of God. Yet, My Father gave His children this Gift. This is how generous He is. This is how much He loves His children. This is the Gift that gave them the freedom to roam the Earth, relish its fruits, and embrace its beauty. But man, tempted by Satan, abused the trust of My Father.
He then became enslaved by Satan and forged a pact with him, where sin will continue to separate all of God's children from Him.

The Gift of My death on the Cross meant that I would break this unnatural bond between man and Satan. So I enabled man to seek salvation through the forgiveness of sin, by My death on the Cross. This means that man has the capacity to escape the grip of Satan, but only those who follow Me, in full humble servitude, can truly gain salvation. Unless you are capable of declaring to Me, Jesus Christ, openly, your weaknesses, your sins and your hatred of one another, through reconciliation, you will not remain pure. Without purity of soul, you are not capable of becoming humble in My Eyes. When you lack humility, pride will flood your soul and you will sin against Me. When you sin against Me, you do this in a number of ways.
You will feed your lusts, greed and pride first. Then you will behave as if you are all knowledgeable, smarter and better than others. Then you will judge others. Then you move to the next stage. You will mock those who are in true union with Me, by declaring them to be imperfect. After that you will create slander against all those who remain True to Me. Yet, you will convince yourself that you are filled with the Holy Spirit. But, it will not be the Holy Spirit, which inspires you. Instead, it will be the spirit of evil, which will invade your soul, and you will believe that you are being guided by Heaven.
When you say you represent Me and that you are better placed than others to be part of My Kingdom and then lie about Me, you need the prayers of others. By that stage, you are halfway into the depths of Hell and without My Intervention you will be lost.
Take My Message. Press it close to your heart and ask: "Jesus is this You? Am I truly in need of Your Help?" and I will give you the answer.
Your Jesus

My loyal disciples, including priests and the sacred servants of all Christian faiths, will remain close by My Side
Friday, November 1st, 2013 @ 23:17

My dearly beloved daughter, the spirit of evil is spreading and it is affecting all those who viciously oppose these Messages. This will lead to more wickedness, lies and elaborate schemes designed to stop this Mission. You must ignore those with evil tongues and those who are eaten up with spiritual jealousy, who would do anything to try and destroy this, My Mission, to bring salvation to all.
I say to you, all who follow Me, these Messages are too important for you to pay any attention to those who hate you in My Name. For it is I, Jesus Christ, they are targeting. Remember that. However, their pride would have them believe that they are acting like this because they love Me. They must know that I would never permit anyone to speak such lies or spread vile rumours about another soul, in My Name.
I, Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, only have the Authority to reveal to you the Truth in these times. The Truth will upset many and the Truth will be bitter to swallow, for it is of such magnitude that only those who are strong in their love for Me will be able to accept it. The Truth will, no matter how difficult it is for you to digest, set you free. It will open your eyes to evil, when it masquerades as good, to wicked men who spread blasphemy when they say they speak My Word and to My enemies who want to destroy God's children.
Many false prophets, spread in every nation, will rise to proclaim that the lies poured out from the mouth of the antichrist, are the truth. They will also say that the antichrist is Me. They will say everything about the Gospels, which will seem to be accurate and will use extracts from the Holy Bible, including quotes from Me, to justify their vile missions. But to those who know Me, you will always find the lie and the heresy buried within their so-called prophetic words. They will contradict these Messages and declare My Word to be heresy. Now is the time to shut out all those voices, which urge you to listen to them, instead of Me. You must continue to remind yourselves of the Truth contained in the Holy Gospels. You must listen to Me, as I instruct you.
Soon, all those who have led My Church in the past, all those who provide God's children with the True Word of God, within My Church, and all those who will remain loyal to the Truth, will be shoved to one side. The Catholic Church will make a number of alarming statements, as to why it has to change and amend every part of its structure. It will use the sins of those in My Church and those who betrayed Me, as the justification to turn My Church inside out. Many of My sacred servants will be weeded out and made scapegoats. Many will be sought out and falsehoods, as well as other claims, will be made against their good name before they are dismissed. This is how many sacred servants will be turned away from My Church in order to allow the enemies of God to take full control from within it. Every calumny committed by the enemies of God against My sacred servants will be publicly applauded and presented as a good thing, so that the good name of the Church remains intact.
Oh how you will all be deceived and how the Truth will be covered up, hidden and then ignored. All these changes will come about quickly, in the future, and the spread of these things will astonish many. Amidst it all, there will be confusion, fear, sadness and great distress. My Church will become so fragmented that all trust within its walls will be broken. This will create a great fear and then, in a manner which will not seem clear at first, the Catholic Church will become a leading force in the new one world religion. This new abomination will declare a great love for the world's poor and hungry. But it will not preach My Word, nor will it remain true to My Church. My Church, however, will continue to live.
My loyal disciples, including priests and the sacred servants of all Christian faiths, will remain close by My Side. My Remnant will stand the test of time and it can never die, for I Am the Church. I can never be destroyed.
Your Jesus

The greatest persecution will be inflicted by Christians upon Christians
Saturday, November 2nd, 2013 @ 20:30

My dearly beloved daughter, I must urge all of God's children to join in union and pray for My Church on Earth.

My Heart heaves at this time, for there is great hatred being shown to those who are practicing Christians. The persecution of Christians will continue in all countries and this includes all those who have, at this time, the freedom to practice their homage to Me. The greatest persecution will be inflicted by Christians upon Christians.The scourging of My Body on Earth will be at its worst from within, as brother will turn against brother and sister against sister. You will soon see the declaration of the new prayers, which will be introduced by the new liturgy.
The main changes will refer to the Holy Communion, where it will be presented as something, which bears little resemblance to My death on the Cross, when I gave up My Body for all sinners. By declaring that Holy Communion means the joining together of all of humanity, as one before God, you will insult Me, because this would be contrary to the Truth. The Truth no longer means the Truth, because so many spread lies, exaggerate and do not understand how easily the Truth can be tampered with. When twisted, in a subtle way, many will not notice the changes, when the Truth is not adhered to.
Lies will take the place of the Truth, divide the human race and create the separation from God, which will lead to destruction.

Always cherish the Truth, because without it the sun will darken, the moon will no longer present light when night falls and the stars will no longer shine in those days which will signal the final darkness, before I come to reclaim My Kingdom.
By then, only the Truth will save you. Your Jesus

I give no man the authority to judge another, to speak evil of another or to cast aspersions on the spirituality of another soul
Sunday, November 3rd, 2013 @ 19:07

My dearly beloved daughter, the way to identify a satanic attack is to look at the way in which souls, who are infested by the evil one, behave. They will never be calm. Instead, with a fierce restlessness, they will scream obscenities, lie and roar with anger at their targets. Satan and his demons are in a terrible rage right now and they will attack everyone and anyone in their path, who proclaims the Word of God, during these times.
Souls who are full of the traits, associated with the devil, such as pride, arrogance and an exaggerated respect for their own flawed human intelligence, will be the first in line to attack those who lead My Remnant Army. Every tactic, every deed, and every verbal onslaught will be laced with a deep and abiding hatred for the souls they will attack. Their attacks will always result as if you, the victims, have been kicked in the stomach - a classic satanic attack.
When you witness calumny, false accusations and slander against you, My beloved followers, you will know then that this could never come from Me, your Jesus. I give no man the authority to judge another, to speak evil of another or to cast aspersions on the spirituality of another soul, in the Eyes of God. Only I, Jesus Christ, can Judge man for his sins. No one else has been given this right, for this belongs only to Me.
When you judge another in My Holy Name, with hatred in your heart, you too will be judged by Me according to your works. When you hurt another child of God and declare them to be evil, then you too will be judged to be evil in My Eyes. An eye for an eye - this will be your punishment. You may think you are justified, when you defame another soul in My Name, but instead you are an enemy in My Eyes. Those who exalt themselves before Me, by claiming that their human
knowledge of spiritual matters makes them superior, then they must know that they will become nothing. When you deny Me and declare that My Holy Word comes from the mouth of the evil one, then you have signed your destiny and you will never see My Face. No Mercy can be yours, for you have blasphemed against Me.
My warning, to those who betray Me, is this. Fight Me and you will never win. My Power is Almighty. No man will ever defeat Me. Yet many will break My Heart as they try to compete with Me, declare themselves to be greater than Me and say that their knowledge is superior to Mine. Away from Me, you ungrateful men and women - your sins of blasphemy will never be forgotten.

The Anger of My Father will increase the more His ungrateful children rise in defiance of His Almighty Covenant
Monday, November 4th, 2013 @ 16:00

My dearly beloved daughter, God's children need to understand the enormity of the great battle, which is taking place between My beloved Father and the evil one. So few of you could ever understand the intensity of this great battle, which has already commenced.
The angels in Heaven have begun the final battle to destroy My Father's enemies on Earth. As the battle rages, it will engulf souls, everywhere. In particular, it will entice the souls of those who are in darkness and who do not truly know Me, to fight against those whose names are in the Book of the Living. Those who do not know Me, who do not believe in Me, who do not believe in My Father and who do not believe that Satan exists, will watch on the sidelines as the two Christian armies clash on Earth. These two sides will be contained within the Christian Churches. Christians on both sides will suffer the greatest persecution and they will be pulled in every direction to encourage them to desert Me.
Innocent souls will be hurt by the hatred shown to them by God's enemies and Satan will use both sides as pawns in a hate-filled agenda, which will result in a terrible desolation on Earth. The desolation will be caused by the sins of man and their betrayal of Me. Their rejection of God, My Father, will be evident when they decide to change the Laws laid down by His Command, so that they can make them acceptable in their sinful lives. Know that this will result in a terrible punishment.
The Anger of My Father will increase, the more His ungrateful children rise in defiance of His Almighty Covenant. Those who prepare for My Second Coming will be barricaded into a prison of sorts, when they will be forced to swallow lies. Should they refuse to accept the heresies, which will be forced down their throats, they will be cast out of their churches. My Word will soon be forgotten. Everything, which I warned you about, will occur exactly as I have told you. Those who are blind to the Truth would rather live a lie, because it will be easier to accept lies, as they will be very appealing in the way in which they will be presented to them.
Heresy will be presented to the masses as part of a new constitution in My Church, which has nothing to do with Me. All will clamour to accept this, for they did not remain alert to the times, which they were warned about, concerning the lead up to the Great Day. Now you must prepare for this Day. You must walk away when My Divinity is challenged, as it will be in many ways, within My Church on Earth. Engage with My enemies and you will not win. Ignore them. Pray for their souls and prepare your own, for soon it will all be over.
Your Jesus

The Light of God will shine down on you and I promise that you will not feel alone
Tuesday, November 5th, 2013 @ 11:00

My dearly beloved daughter, God has already begun the final preparations to ensure that salvation is brought to all of His children. So many of you are oblivious to what exactly the Second Coming means and, therefore, you do not prepare yourselves. Many of you do not believe it will happen for a very long time. So, only those who are truly prepared will be ready to greet Me, their Bridegroom, dressed and presented to Me as is befitting. Others will be asleep, unprepared and confused. Some will not believe in Me until I am seen in every part of the world. Some will die of shock, but most will be filled with joy and wonder. Those who allowed themselves to be deceived will be forgiven if they beg Me to grant them immunity. Sadly, many will refuse My Great Mercy because their hearts will have turned to stone and nothing will open them.
The time ahead will be full of great revelations and special Graces poured out upon you. I do this to make you stronger and stronger, so that you will not sell your soul in return for worldly attractions. More and more of you will become closer to Me and as I speak to your soul, you will feel at peace amidst the horror of the great apostasy. When you witness this horror, you will be better equipped to withstand it and help others.
The Light of God will shine down on you and I promise that you will not feel alone, even if you are rejected by those who know no better. When I walked the Earth the Pharisees turned so many away from Me. The same thing will happen now. Many of you will be encouraged to, not only reject My Call from Heaven at this time, but My Teachings . My Teachings can never be changed because they are the Truth and only the Truth can save you.
Your Jesus

All the upheavals you are about to witness will be testament to the Truth of the prophecies given to My beloved John in the Book of Revelation
Thursday, November 7th, 2013 @ 18:35

My dearly beloved daughter, the time for the new beginning is close. As the Great Tribulation continues to be felt, many events will take place.
The enemies within My Church will, without any sense of shame, try to say that a new one-world secular church, which welcomes all sinners and all religions, is approved by God. When those in My Church welcome the secular world, it will no longer follow the Truth. When you are a true follower of Mine, your faith will be seen in your deeds and works. When you are Mine, you will remain true to the Word of God. When you keep My Word, you are obedient to everything that I taught you. When you are not of Me, you will curse your brothers and sisters. When you are not of Me, you will hate those who are of Me. When you believe that you will have eternal life without having to earn it, then you are very much mistaken.
If you say that sin is natural and that only a just and fair God would forgive every sin, then this is true. But if you believe that eternal life is your natural right and that you do not need to repent first, then you are denying the Truth. I love every one of you. I would never be cruel, unkind, vicious, abusive, or hurt any of God's children. But, I will never open the door to My Kingdom to any sinner, unless they show true remorse for their wrongdoing. When I lead you towards salvation, I open every door, so that I can welcome you on the last day. Many doors are opening now, but few are entering them. Not one of you will enter My Kingdom, unless you obey My Word given to you in the Holy Gospels. Your faith must be pure. Your love for one another must be genuine and your obedience to My Word will gain for you the Gift of eternal life.
Many who call themselves Christians are disloyal to My Church. You receive Me in Holy Communion with blackened souls. You ignore My Teachings and condone sins you believe to be insignificant in your eyes. You spread lies with a wicked tongue about others and you condemn many in My Holy Name. You were given the Truth in the Holy Gospels, yet you do not practice what they teach you. My Love for you means that, while many of you will not earn the Salvation I gave the world by My death on the Cross, I will still give all of you the chance to see the Truth during My Divine Mercy when I come before you to help you decide whether or not you will accept My Gift.
All the upheavals you are about to witness will be testament to the Truth of the prophecies given to My beloved John in the Book of Revelation. When you see the Church enter into union with the secular world, you will know that the time has come for My Mission to gather souls all over the world.
Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: When a mission, which professes to speak the Word of God, is false there will be no hatred shown towards it
Friday, November 8th, 2013 @ 12:09

My dear children, as God's cherished little ones, you must never allow disagreements to turn into hatred for one another. The evil one creates terrible suffering amongst you by spreading his evil infestation and especially against God's chosen visionaries and prophets.
When God is present in a Mission, which is sanctioned by Him on Earth, in order to save souls, Satan will always attack it. You will know God's true prophets by the persecution and hatred, which is shown to them. You will know them by the public rejection of their missions and the wicked actions inflicted by others against them.
When a mission, which professes to speak the Word of God, is false there will be no hatred shown towards it, because Satan will never publicly attack those he deceives. When my Son makes Himself known, He will always be violated, as the sin of man separates him from God. When my Son walked the Earth, everywhere He went they screamed at Him. They cursed Him and threw stones at Him and all those who followed Him. And while they declared Him to be a fraud, they fawned over the many false prophets, who tried to compete with Him. The same will be true as He makes His final journey to gather up all those who remain in Him and with Him. He will unite all those who live by His Teachings and who remain true and humble servants. Then, with the help of His Remnant Church, He will fight to the bitter end to salvage as many souls as possible, including the souls of all His enemies and all those who refuse to accept Him.
If you love my Son, you must never hurt Him by hating one another. My Son has told you that you cannot remain in union with Him when there is hatred in your heart.
Pray, pray, pray that all of you who declare yourselves to be Christians will follow the example set by my Son. Your beloved Mother
Mother of Salvation

Many will soon begin to use their knowledge of science to evaluate the Most Holy Gospels
Saturday, November 9th, 2013 @ 11:48

My dearly beloved daughter, many will soon begin to use their knowledge of science to evaluate the Most Holy Gospels. Instead of declaring the Truth of My Word, which comes from the Wisdom of God, they will start to twist it so as to give it a more modern image.
All of My Words, contained in the Holy Gospel, will be interpreted differently. They will say My Word means something new, which will be more relevant in the world today. They will try to give examples as to how I would teach you, were I to walk the Earth at this time. Gone will be the simplicity of the Word of God, which is for everyone. Those who are intelligent, knowledgeable and who are proud of man's progress in the world of science, will then begin to make insulting statements.
The Church will embrace so-called new scientific discoveries, which will discredit what is contained in the Holy Bible. They will reveal what they say will be new evidence, which casts doubt as to how the world was created. They will then say that much of what is contained in the Bible are simply metaphors designed to create peace amongst men. They will use the message of humanism, love of one another, in terms of your ability to look after the poor, uneducated and needy, as a substitute for the Truth you were given in the Gospels. Then, the false new doctrines which will seem similar to the Truth, will be embraced by priests, and only those who remain firm to My Word will keep the Truth alive.
My beloved followers, when you find that very few will listen anymore to the Truth - the Word of God - then you must comfort each other. You must continue to remind those in My Churches, who will applaud the heresies, which will be introduced, of the Truth for many of them will be none the wiser. So far will they fall away from Me, that they will readily accept such changes. It will be much easier for those with little faith to accept the word of those who demand reformation, than to remain true to the Word of God.
The call for the first changes will be made soon. With a sweetness that will soothe and passionate talk about the need to rise up as one united world - to show love and tolerance for all - you will be led into the greatest error. Many will be shocked at how quickly My Church will seem to embrace the secular world. Many will be enthralled at the way in which different religions, pagans and heretics, will scramble to join this new, one world charitable church. They will say: "At last a church which is tolerant has reached out to all." No longer will they feel ashamed to show disobedience to God. Instead, they will proudly proclaim that their wretched sins are not only acceptable in the Eyes of God, but they are no longer deemed to be sins at all. This will create great rejoicing everywhere.
For the first time in history, those who lead My Church into error will be loved, adored and virtually no criticism leveled upon them.
The greatest heresy, not seen since My death on the Cross, will now devour My Church on Earth. They will fill My Churches with insulting pagan symbols and I will be nowhere to be seen. And while they fill the buildings, which they created to adore Me, My True Church, comprising of those who remain faithful to the Truth, will become the only True Temple of God, for they will never accept the desecration of My Body. Their faith will enable them to spread the Gospels and keep the Flame of the Holy Spirit alight.
Your Jesus

God the Father: No scientific evaluation will make sense when two suns are seen
Sunday, November 10th, 2013 @ 15:00

My dearest daughter, My Desire is to gather all of My children together, very soon, to witness My Promise. My Great Gift will come in the middle of the terrible spiritual persecution, when all that I Am will be denied. New gods, none of which exist, will be presented to the world. Covered with a glittering façade, they will be designed to stop all belief in My Existence. All of this heresy will extinguish the Light of God.
Soon, the stars will no longer shine with their great intensity. Soon, new, unexpected signs, which will defy all human understanding of science, will be shown by Me, to a disbelieving world, as the beginning of My Intervention is
revealed. No scientific evaluation will make sense when two suns are seen. No definition, by man's limited knowledge, will make sense. Yet, they will take every sign, given to the world from Heaven, and say that this other human life exists in the universe.
I Am the Creator of all life. I created man. I created the world. Never deny this, for when you do you will be following a false doctrine. Every intervention from Heaven - and there will be many - will be explained away. When you see these signs, know that the Day of the Second Coming is close.
I ask you, dear children, to never deny Me or to deny My Promise to bring the world the final peace and reconciliation, which is yours if you will accept it on My Terms and not your own. My Will is about to be accomplished at last. To prepare you, I will present to the world many miracles in the skies, in the universe and planetary system. When you witness these events, I want you to be joyful, for you will know then that I Am heralding the return of My Son to complete His Promise of eternal salvation.
Wipe the tears from your eyes. I know how difficult your trials will be. I refer to all of My Children, including believers and non- believers, as well as those guilty of terrible sin - none of you are excluded. When you become reconciled to My Son, you will become part of Him and you will reign with Him in Paradise, forever.
Your beloved Father God the Most High

Mother of Salvation: Salvation is yours only through reconciliation with God
Sunday, November 10th, 2013 @ 15:20

My dear child, my role as Mother of Salvation is to remind you of all that I have told you down through the centuries. Love one another as my Son loves you. Show compassion for everyone and especially for those who persecute you. Listen to what I revealed to visionaries at La Salette and Fatima and study them in great detail. Very little of what I instructed was carried out by you. My warnings were dismissed and the consequences of ignoring what was given to you will now become a reality.
When Heaven reveals messages to humanity, it is like communicating to a large stone fortress. Some of my revelations seeped through and were followed. Many were simply discarded by those of little faith, and the fortress became impenetrable against the intervention from Heaven, given to you to increase your faith and to keep you safe in God's Arms.
My role as Co-Redemptrix means that my power against the devil has been strengthened, in a way that has not been granted to me by God before. So now is the time when all devotion to me will be carefully dismissed, by the enemies of my Son. When veneration to me is rushed through and when the request to safeguard countries against Communism is twisted, then my wishes will not have been carried out. I will, from now on, be a rarity in the official patronage normally afforded me, the Mother of God, in my Son's Churches on Earth. My power against the beast will be avoided by the removal of my image, my Holy Rosary and other devotions to me from many Catholic Churches.
Then, the temples of God will remove all traces of my Son, Jesus Christ, in preparation for the beast, who will come and sit on the throne in the highest temple of God. Then the true meaning of reconciliation with Jesus Christ will be adapted when they will say that it is no longer necessary to ask God to forgive you for your sins, if you lead a good life. People will start to believe in their own views as to what makes them good in the Eyes of God. But you must never ever forget that salvation, a Gift to every single sinner in the world, can never become theirs unless they ask God to forgive them first. This is the kernel of the Covenant, which was gained for the human race by my Son's death on the Cross. Jesus Christ won, for the world, the salvation from sin and the Gift of Eternal Life. In order to receive this Gift you must ask God to forgive you for your sins.
Salvation is yours, only through reconciliation with God. Your beloved Mother

My Father's punishments have begun and the world will witness many more ecological upheavals
Tuesday, November 12th, 2013 @ 15:52

My dearly beloved daughter, it is a mistake to believe that God would not mete out His Justice in the world at this time. My Father's punishments have begun and the world will witness many more ecological upheavals as the purification of the Earth begins.
The preparations are now underway and soon the enemies of God will be weeded out and punished, for they will never turn and ask for My Mercy. My Father's Anger is great and woe to those who defy the Word of God, for they will be felled and trampled upon, as the final cleansing of the Earth will clash with the infestation of the evil one - all at the same time.
When you see nature's elements react fiercely, you will know that the Hand of Justice has fallen. The pride of man, his self-obsession and his belief in his own flawed intelligence in spiritual matters, have brought upon the human race the outpouring of fire from the four bowls upon the four corners of the Earth.
You have ignored the warnings and so the battle to destroy sin has well and truly commenced. Jesus Christ
Son of Man

The first sign will be that the Earth will spin faster. The second sign concerns the sun, which will loom larger, brighter and begin to spin
Tuesday, November 12th, 2013 @ 20:30

My dearly beloved daughter, as My Time approaches, many will be asleep, but those who are blessed with their eyes open to My Light, will know the signs. They will also be given the blessings to prepare and only those who cling to Me will be able to endure the changes.
The closer the Day of My Great Coming draws, the more people, who say they love God, will withdraw from Me. Even those who say they are holy and exalt themselves within the hierarchy of My Church on Earth, won't be able to see the Truth. They will not see the Truth because they will be so busy attending to matters and ceremonies, which will be insulting to Me.
The first sign will be that the Earth will spin faster. The second sign concerns the sun, which will loom larger, brighter and begin to spin. Beside it you will see a second sun. Then the weather will cause the world to shake and the changes will mean that many parts of the Earth will be destroyed. These punishments - and there will be many - will strip humanity of its arrogance, so that souls will beg for the Mercy of God. Nothing else will stir the hearts of stone of those who have shut the Love of God out of their lives.
The sin of humanity will escalate quickly and the sin of idolatry will wrap itself threefold around the Earth. Paganism, dressed like royal monarchy, will infiltrate My Church on Earth. When the heathens embrace My Church, it will not be to adore God. When pagans, atheists and other non-believers, who outwardly reject the Existence of God, embrace My Church, it will not be to Me, Jesus Christ, they will bend their knee. When My Church declares that it welcomes all, do not be fooled. It will not mean they are welcoming pagans into My Church, so that they can bow before My Tabernacle. No, it will be to parade idolatry, caused by the sin of pride, before Me, to desecrate the Holy and Sacred Tabernacles. They will place pagan symbols on My Altars and demand that unsuspecting congregations bow and accept their fellow brothers and sisters, with grace and generosity. All will be asked to deny the Truth, so as to welcome false worshippers, who will trample on My Altars. Then, the Hand of God will fall.
Wars will spread; earthquakes will shake the four corners of the Earth and famine will grip mankind and every wicked gesture and insult made before God will result in a terrible chastisement. When those who accept My Mercy lead My Church - every demon will curse these children of God. To protect them, God will intervene and woe to those who spit in the Face of their Creator.
The time has come. Those who curse Me will suffer. Those who follow Me will live through this persecution, until the Day when I come to sweep them into My Merciful Arms. And then, only those who remain, because they refused My Hand of Mercy, will be given over to the beast they idolized and to whom they sought pleasure from.
So many people will reject Me, right up to the end. Two-thirds will spit at Me, fight My Intervention and scream every kind of obscenity at Me. As the Day draws closer and closer, the hatred against Me, will be witnessed for all to see. Even those who give the world the impression that they honour God will curse Me quietly.
The day when the deceit of the beast will be exposed for all to see will be a day no one will forget. For that day, as the world will see the imposter, the antichrist, rise with My Crown on his head - dressed in the robes of red - will be the day when fire will pour from his mouth. As the horror finally sinks in, fire will envelop him and he and all those who pledged allegiance to him will be cast into the abyss. And then I will come as I have told you. I will raise up My Church and bring the world together in union with the Holy Will of My Father and peace, at last, will reign.
All I have told you is true. All that will happen will happen as I have told you. It will happen quickly, for despite My Anger, which is caused by the hypocrisy and ungratefulness of man, I come only to bring this suffering, finally, to an end. I come to save all sinners, but many will not want to be saved.
Be strong, My beloved followers, for I will protect all sinners, who accept My Hand of Mercy during The Warning. So every child of God, believers and non-believers, will be included in this Great Intervention from Heaven. But after this time, the angel of God will divide the good from the wicked. The time is short.
Your Jesus

Never before will their faith be put to such a test
Thursday, November 14th, 2013 @ 12:00

My dearly beloved daughter, the Light of God shines down upon all of His children, who are in union with Me, Jesus Christ, at this time. All of those Christians in the world who live by My Word, who eat My Body and drink My Blood, will experience a spiritual suffering like no other, because of their belief in Me. I refer to all Christians who live by the Truth, who behave as I have taught them and who follow My Teachings Word for Word.
All those, including those who have never heard of these, My Messages for the world, will soon understand what it is like to live in Me and with Me. Never before will their faith be put to such a test and sadly, many will be unable to withstand the pressures they will have to deal with, because of the hatred which will be shown to them. They will do all they can to remain true to the Holy Gospels, but by doing so they will attract terrible hatred and they will be called liars. It will not be long before all Christians, who will defiantly proclaim My Word, will be accused of being right-winged bullies, when the true culprits will be the ones who hurl the abuse at them.
I urge all of you to remain silent and to never respond to bullies who try to destroy your faith and love for Me. Those who will spit venom and scream at you need your prayers and forgiveness. By praying for such souls, you will destroy Satan's influence and he will find it difficult to vent his anger at you.
Pray, pray, pray for all those who will be used as pawns in the bitter fight to dismantle My Church on Earth. Please recite this Crusade Prayer to withstand religious persecution.
Crusade Prayer (126) To withstand religious persecution:

Dear Jesus, help me to withstand any kind of persecution in Your Holy Name. Help those who fall into error, in the belief that they bear witness to Your Work.
Open the eyes of all those who may be tempted to destroy others, through wicked acts, deeds or gestures. Protect me against the enemies of God, who will rise up to try and silence Your Word and who try to banish You. Help me to forgive those who betray You and give me the Grace to remain firm in my love for You.
Help me to live the Truth, which You taught us and to remain under Your Protection, forever. Amen.

Go, all of you who truly love Me and follow everything I taught you. Love one another as I have told you. Never show hatred for others. Instead, pray for those who persecute you. Show love when hatred is shown to you, because this will be your weapon against the power of evil.
Your Jesus

You will stand before Me alone - with no one next to you
Friday, November 15th, 2013 @ 20:00

My dearly beloved daughter, by the Authority of My Father, God the Most High, I wish to inform all those who are suffering, in My Name, that the time is close for The Warning to take place.
Those of you, who have been given knowledge of this, My Great Day of Mercy, will see the signs shortly. You must confess your transgressions before Me, so that you will be adequately prepared for this event, which will shock the world.
I do this soon, so that I can save those people who have cut the umbilical cord, which ties them to Me, before it is too late. You must trust in Me and gather in prayer so that souls in darkness do not perish before I grant them immunity for their sins. Look now into your hearts and souls and see them as I see you. What do you see? Will you be able to stand before Me and say "Jesus, I do everything You desire of me to live the life which You expect me to."? Will you say "Jesus, I offend You, because I cannot help it, so please have Mercy on my soul."? Or will you say "Jesus I have sinned, but only because I need to defend myself."?
You will stand before Me alone - with no one next to you. I will show you your soul. You will see every stain upon it. You will relive the sin and then I will give you the time to ask Me to show you My Mercy. Not because you are entitled to My Mercy - but only because I decide to give you this Gift.
My Day will dawn, unexpectedly, through the signs which will be shown to you in advance.

I have spent three years trying to open your eyes to the Truth. Some of you have accepted it. Others have thrown it back in My Face. Now is the time of My Divine Mercy and only those who open their hearts to Me, and who accept Me, will be given the chance to redeem themselves.
Be thankful for My unconditional Love. Your Jesus

Billions will convert and recognise God, the Triune God, for the first time
Saturday, November 16th, 2013 @ 22:17

My dearly beloved daughter, when I come to the world in My Divine Mercy, people will be given the chance to seek My Mercy, for this will be the first true confession many of them will have partaken in.
Everyone, no matter who they are, will experience this unique revelation of Mine, blessed by the Authority of My Father. The Illumination of Conscience will bring with it much pain, because the sorrow lost souls will experience will be such that they will not be able to withstand the shock. Many will faint and collapse, overcome with grief. But they will realise how much their soul needs to be cleansed first, before they are ready to enter My Eternal Paradise. These people will then know what is expected of them and they will suffer penance for some time, after the Great Event. Many people will think that they are dreaming. Some will think that it is the end of the world, but it will not be. It will be the Final Warning, however, which will be given to humanity to help them redeem themselves before God.
Billions will convert and recognise God, the Triune God, for the first time and they will be grateful for the proof which they will be given as to the Existence of their Creator. Some will simply cower from My Light and this will bring them incredible pain and they will hide and turn their backs without a shred of remorse in their souls. They will deny My Intervention. Then the rest will rejoice, when they experience My Rays of Mercy, for these souls will be so thankful to witness My Presence that they will gravitate towards My Light with ease and with a longing for My Presence, which will be beyond their grasp, as this will not be the time for the Gates to My New Paradise to be opened. And so, they will then have to do penance as My disciples, on behalf of those souls who will reject My Hand of Mercy.
After the Great Intervention by God, to give humanity the chance to prepare themselves for My Second Coming, the world will be asking many questions. Some will be so changed within their souls that they will devote much time in helping to convert those they want to help save from deceit. Others will be remorseful and it will take some time for them to fully understand the significance of their presentation before Me and they will spend much attention to reconciling themselves with Me.
Then the enemies of God will deny The Warning ever happened and they will fool millions into believing that it was a cosmic event, when the light of the sun overtook the whole of the planet by a one-off event, caused by the movement of the Earth on its axis. Nothing could be further from the Truth. And, while they will put forth all these causes, they will deny that God Exists and lead many away from Me. Sadly, many will not come back to Me and only with God's Interventions, when He will be forced to punish His enemies, in order to bring them back to their senses, can souls be purified.
Be thankful for these Mercies, as without this Gift from God very few people will be able to enter the Gates of Paradise.

Your Jesus

I Am coming to renew the Earth, to free man from his misery, sorrow and sin
Sunday, November 17th, 2013 @ 14:00

My dearly beloved daughter, I want the world to see Me, their beloved Saviour, the Son of man, in all My Glory, so that they will draw into My Divine Mercy.
I want all those, especially those who do not believe in God, to see Me and run to Me first. They are My first concern and I tell them this. You do not know Me. You do not see Me. You do not want to believe in Me, but I love you. I want you to be part of My Kingdom, so I can lavish upon you all the Gifts of My New Paradise, My New World, My New Beginning. I want you, your family, your relatives and friends to be as one, with Me and the whole of humanity. You must wait until the great event, the day when the world will alight with My Rays and when it will stay still for fifteen minutes. When you see this and witness it, you must not be afraid. Know then that My Love is Divine and that the world will, from that day, change beyond recognition.
Do not try to run away from Me, for I Am coming with good news. I Am coming to renew the Earth, to free man from his misery, sorrow and sin. I Am coming to destroy all evil in the world by providing everyone with the proof of My Existence. When this is given to you, you must allow Me to prepare you for the Eternal Life I promised. Eternal Life is a life where you will live in body and soul with Me forever. I will put you out of your misery and eliminate the pain, which you have to endure because of the existence of Satan and he will be banished for eternity.
Do not reject Me, for I do not want to lose you. I Am your Salvation. I Am the Truth. I Am your beloved Jesus Christ and I, at last, will soon make Myself known to the world and especially to those who do not believe in Me.
Your Jesus

I come only as a God of Mercy. I do not come to frighten you for I truly love each of you
Monday, November 18th, 2013 @ 20:10

My dearly beloved daughter, all must prepare themselves so that they are fit to come before Me, for I will come like a thief in the night and many will not know what is happening. Therefore, it is important that each one of you confesses to Me now.
The Truth of My Most Holy Word will become pronounced, as twisted versions replace it by My enemies, who will be daring in their endeavours to deceive you. Now is the time to focus on your own souls and the state they are in. To the man who does not believe in Me I say to him. When I come before you will you be relieved to know Who I Am? Will you come with Me? I will take you and wipe away your tears and you will live a glorious life, once you confess to Me and ask Me to take you into My Mercy.
To the man who believes in Me, will you be able to stand before Me, without shame? Will you come before Me, knowing all that you do about what I taught you, with a clean soul? No matter. When you say to Me, "Jesus forgive me, I want to follow You.", you will be saved.
To the man who believes in Me, but who believes he is exemplary and in no need of confession, are you also fit to come before Me? When I show you the state of your soul, will you argue with Me and say that you are fit to come before Me when you are not? If you cannot accept My Gift of Mercy and admit your wrongdoing, then you will remain separate from Me and I will give you only one more chance of reprieve.
To all of humanity, I ask you to prepare first your soul. You must fix every part of your soul, before you are ready to stand complete in My Presence during The Warning. If you don't, you will have to endure a painful purification and your Purgatory will be endured on Earth, before the Day My Second Coming dawns. I urge you to say this Crusade Prayer for each of your own souls and that of your loved ones.
Crusade Prayer (127) To save my soul and those of my loved ones:

O Jesus, prepare me, so I can come before You without shame. Help me and my loved ones (name them here....) to get ready to confess all our wrong doings. To admit our short-comings. To ask for the forgiveness of all sins. To show love to those we have wronged. To beg for Mercy for salvation. To humble ourselves before You, so that on the Day of the Great Illumination, my conscience and those of (name them here.....) will be clear and that You will flood my soul with Your Divine Mercy. Amen.
Now is the time to remind yourselves of everything that I taught you. Now is the time to examine The Ten Commandments and ask yourselves if you have truly lived your lives accordingly.
Be honest with yourselves because if you are not, you will - either way - be shown how you have grieved Me in your lifetime. But, let Me give you comfort.
I come only as a God of Mercy. I do not come to frighten you, for I truly love each of you, no matter what you have done, but My Patience is limited. Only those who accept the grievous nature of their sins against God can be enveloped into My Divine Mercy. Those who reject Me will have little time to redeem themselves, for I will separate the sheep from the goats. One side will come with Me. The other side will be left and then the New Beginning will be made known to every creature. Only those who love Me will be given Eternal Life.
Heed now My Call, for I do this to ensure that as many of you as possible are prepared well before the Day of the The Warning.
Your Jesus

On that day, I will gather the Living
Tuesday, November 19th, 2013 @ 20:00

My dearly beloved daughter, in many Christian lives, I have become like an embarrassing relative Who must be catered to, from time to time, but kept out of sight, at all times. This is how many of those who were born Christians, and who have fallen away from Me, view Me now. I Am of little consequence, and yet when they are in trouble, they will call out to Me, involuntarily, because it is second-nature to them.
Why, oh why, can they not accept Me? What has separated man from Me? Why have My sacred servants failed to bring them to Me? My suffering is the same today as it was during My Passion and now those who have remained true to Me will shortly desert Me. They will do this because they will begin to re-evaluate their understanding of Who, exactly, I Am and what My Covenant truly means - all because of the heresies to come.
All homage to Me, in My Churches, will soon be reduced to a mere nod in My direction. They will no longer genuflect before My Tabernacles. They will not bow before Me or kneel, nor will they pray before My Corpus on the Cross, for it will not be My Image they will be asked to venerate. I will be scourged and made to look ridiculous. My Words will be turned into the most peculiar verbiage and the Truth of My death on the Cross will be thrown out.
My Presence is still on Earth at this time. You must not desert Me, for when you do, My Light will be extinguished and then you will become engulfed with darkness. Only those who remain loyal to Me can retain My Flame and when the Light of My Church on Earth is reduced to but just a faint glimmer - then the final call will be heard from Heaven. On that day I will gather the Living. The remainder will be left with the enemies of God to whom they gave their allegiance. No joy will they experience after that.
Your Jesus

When I come as the King of Mercy, not one soul will be left in any doubt as to Who I Am and What I Am
Wednesday, November 20th, 2013 @ 14:15

My dearly beloved daughter, tell all of My followers - all those who believe in Me, Jesus Christ - that they must allocate time each day to Me in prayer, in order to save the souls of those who are lost to Me. By the Graces, which I give to you, I desire that in return, you will help to bring Me the souls of those who break My Heart.
I must ask that you endure the pain you will feel, because of the separation of humanity from Me, Jesus Christ. This will be caused by the schism in My Church on Earth. By accepting this suffering with complete submission, I can conquer the grip, which the evil one exerts over those who are too weak to proclaim the True Word of God. You must never fear this Mission, for it is given to the world because of the Generosity of My beloved Father. He simply wants to reclaim His Creation, intact, so as not to lose one single child of His.
No matter who scourges you, mocks you or persecutes you, just remember the punishment, which befalls all those who spit in My Face. Then, ignoring the taunts, you must pray fervently for each of these poor souls. Be generous in heart and you will be filled with the Holy Spirit, so that then you will fight, alongside My Heavenly Army, to salvage the world from evil. You must await therefore, with love and trust, and I will bring you great Blessings.
Hope must never be discarded because of fear. Fear must never blind you to the task which is required of you, so when I come as the King of Mercy, not one soul will be left in any doubt as to Who I Am and What I Am. Gather together. Unite. Bring all souls into My Merciful Arms. To help Me do this, you must recite this special Crusade Prayer to help Me gather and unite all souls.
Crusade Prayer (128) To gather and unite all souls:

Dearest Jesus, help us, Your beloved disciples, to gather the world in Your Arms and present to You the souls who are in most need of Your Great Mercy.
Empower us with the Gift of the Holy Spirit to ensure that the Flame of Truth engulfs all those who have become separated from You.
Unite all sinners so that each is given every chance of reconciliation.

Give all of us the strength to remain firm to Your Holy Word when we are forced to reject the Truth, which has been proclaimed to the world through the Most Holy Gospels.
We remain in You, with You and for You, every single step of this, our journey to salvation. Amen.

Be at peace. Trust in Me. Leave all your prayers at My Feet and I will respond to every single request made of Me to save any soul whose name is presented to Me.
Your Jesus

Love thrives because it is a Gift from God and has the power to destroy evil
Saturday, November 23rd, 2013 @ 17:00

My dearly beloved daughter, I wish to explain the importance of love and how with it, you can defeat evil and how, without it, evil spreads.
Satan is incapable of love, but instead is self-obsessed with what he believes to be his power and greatness. When he infests souls, the first thing he does is to destroy love within the soul. When he achieves this, he will instill a terrible hatred in that soul and it is this hatred which causes division. Division and disagreements, inspired by hatred, can lead to desperate deeds carried out by one soul against another. These hate-filled deeds can very often lead to terrible cruelty and even murder. The sin of pride is instilled in souls, who open themselves up to the devil and this leads to ruthless ambition and greed. But where there is love, there is the Presence of God.
Love thrives because it is a Gift from God and has the power to destroy evil. Love is not selfish. Love is generous, forgiving and untainted by the sin of pride. You must ask God, every day, for the Gift of Love and when you are given this, use it as your armor against hatred. Love, when present in a pure soul, attracts hatred from those souls who have banished God from their lives. They cannot bear the Light of God, which shines from the souls of those who are filled with God's Love.
Go now in the knowledge that Love must be used to help the souls of all those who are in great need of My Help. Please recite this Crusade Prayer for the Gift of Love.
Crusade Prayer (129) For the Gift of Love:

O God, please fill me with Your Love.

Help me to share the Gift of Love with all those in need of Your Mercy. Help me to love You more.
Help me to love all those in need of Your Love. Help me to love Your enemies.
Allow the love You Bless me with to be used to engulf the hearts of everyone I come into contact with.

With the Love, which You infuse in my soul, help me to conquer all evil, convert souls and defeat the devil and all those wicked agents of his, who try to destroy the Truth of Your Holy Word. Amen.
