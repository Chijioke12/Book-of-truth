Ruthless, he and all those who are easily led by him will do all they can to discredit My Word given to you. You must rise and ignore such taunts.
As you have surrendered your free will, all that matters now is your total obedience to Me. Allow Me, in My Divine Wisdom, to lay out before you My perfect pathway to Paradise on Earth.
My followers must heed My warning also. You will come under fierce attack, each and every one of you, for proclaiming My Word. This is a mission like no other.
You, My army, will lead the flock of My Remnant Church to the gates of Paradise.

This will cause you much personal persecution and it will not be an easy journey.

You must unite together and give each other strength for in numbers you will find comfort in each other.

In all corners of the earth My army gathers now.

All seers who are communicated with the Divine Truth, through My Mother, will ignite the flame of the Holy Spirit along with My prophets so that the remnant army is adequately prepared for the battle ahead.
Never doubt My Love. Remember that only those who follow Me can enter the New Paradise.

When those who come to you and torment you, remember your duty is to forgive them and then pray for their souls.

Show love to those who torment you in My Name. This way you can defeat Satan and he loses his power over you. I will instruct you every step of your journey.
I walk with you always.

I know My own and they know Me. Your Jesus

New Paradise: You will be made of a pure body, incorruptible, free from disease, physical death and ageing.
Tuesday, June 26th, 2012 @ 20:00

My dearly beloved daughter the New Paradise has now been completed in its full glory ready for all of God's children on earth.
It will be presented, in all its glory, just like the Paradise created by My Eternal Father for His children in the beginning. How the angels sing and rejoice for the time to unveil this great splendour to a disbelieving world is very close. It will be presented by Me when the New Jerusalem descends upon the earth at the ringing of My Second Coming.
You, My daughter, will be told to announce this just before I make myself known.

Only those who accept Me as the Messiah will be able to enter its magnificent gates.

Every call from Heaven will be made to reach out to all those who will still reject My great gift right up to the very last trumpet.

Then it will be too late for those poor souls. They will be beyond help after that as My Mercy will have been thrown back in My Face in outright rejection.
All that matters now is to warn all those who are in danger of losing their souls to Satan.

Gather them up My followers. Coax them gently into My flock. Never give up your prayers to salvage them.

Oh My beloved followers if you could see the New Paradise when Heaven and Earth will merge as one you would drop down on your knees and weep with joy and relief.
For those of you frightened about the end times, when the earth as you know it will change, then you must allow Me to ease your worries.
You will take your family with you and all with rejoice in pure utter love and harmony.

You will be made of a pure body, incorruptible, free from disease, physical death and ageing.

You all will have your own dwelling with grass, trees, mountains, rivers, streams and flowers surrounding you in all their glorious beauty.
Animals will be tame and live in peace and in harmony with all of God's children.

You see your children marry, have children and the miracle of families, risen from the dead, will be witnessed by all.

This resurrection will be like no other joy imaginable.

You will be reunited with your loves ones who passed away in this life and went to Heaven.

You will have nations, twelve in total, all signified by the twelve stars in the crown on my My Mother's Immaculate head, all of which will be governed by Me with My Apostles and Prophets.
This is My Kingdom, promised by My Father since He created Paradise on Earth. Anyone who rejects it will perish.

Pray that all of God's children will have the purity of soul to enable them to come home to My Father's Kingdom on Earth, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be world without end, for ever and ever.
Your Jesus

God the Father: I reveal My future plans for the New Heavens and the New Earth.
Wednesday, June 27th, 2012 @ 20:00

My dearest daughter today I reveal to all My Children My future plans for the New Heavens and the New Earth

When they merge into one glorious Paradise there will be twelve nations.

These nations will consist of some nations in the world who have shown allegiance to Me, God the Father, My Son Jesus Christ and the Mother of God, Queen of Heaven.
Those scattered will be brought together to join those other nations as one, united as one Holy Family.

My Will, will be honoured. You will all have the gift of free will but it will be entwined with Mine. Only then will the truth of Paradise be truly revealed.
My Twelve nations are signified in the twelve stars on the woman in the Book of Revelation. The woman is the Mother of God and she wears the twelve stars to signify two things.
The twelve apostles helped My Son to set up His Church on Earth.

The twelve specially chosen nations will form the one true apostolic Church on the New Earth when Heaven and Earth merge as one in My New Glorious Paradise.
This is the moment I have been waiting patiently for.

My Divine Will, which created Paradise for Adam and Eve and which was thrown aside caused by temptation by the evil one, will now be done and the this time Paradise will be perfect.
My Son, King of Mankind, King of the Universe, will reign over My New Paradise on Earth. He will appoint leaders in every nation all joined together by My Divine Will.
The people of those nations will honour My Son in the way in which He must be, the only way, in peace and love for one another.

His Blessed Mother, the Mother of Salvation, was crowned Queen of Heaven and will also reign as Queen of the New Paradise.
Her Coronation in Heaven was a very special Divine Manifestation of her role in the future of the salvation of the world.

She was crowned in great honour and splendour for the role she played, not only as the Mother of God and as spouse of the Holy Spirit, but as the Mother of Salvation given the power to destroy Satan.
It was My Beloved Son who lovingly placed the crown of twelve stars on the head of the Mother of God at her Coronation.
It will be My Son who will place the crown on her head in the New Paradise as Queen of all God's children.

My Divine Plan to save humanity has already begun.

It is My desire that this Mission will help Me gather lost souls in every corner of the earth and save them from the enemy before it is too late.
My Divine intervention will prove My love for all of My children.

Nothing is impossible. Nothing is hopeless in My battle against Satan's army.

I will bring you a new world that will astound you in all its magnificent glory. It is ready. Its beauty and splendour is beyond your human capacity to envisage.
When you do witness it, you will have eternal life.

Pray that those poor children of mine who do not believe in Me, God the Most High, who do not obey My Laws and who commit terrible atrocities against each other, repent.
I do not want to lose one child of Mine.

Help Me to bring them this wonderful glorious inheritance. Unfortunately it must be by their own free will.

I love you children with a passion unknown to humanity. Come to Me through My Son as one.
The time for the New Paradise on earth is very near but you have been accorded the time to help convert humanity through this Mission of the 7th Angel on earth who works with My Son to bring My family to Me.
Your Loving Father

Creator of all things visible and invisible God the Most High

My Church must trust Me. They must remove their shackles of fear and doubt and allow Me make myself known

Thursday 28 June 2012 3pm

My dearly beloved daughter it must be known that those who profess to come in My Name, as prophets, but who do not speak in the tongues from Heaven, are increasing in numbers.
So many of these souls are being infected by fallen angels and speak in carefully constructed, but loving tones, reminiscent of what you would expect to be My Sacred Voice.
Oh how My poor devoted followers are being deceived now and how confused they will be. Who to trust? Who to follow? Who to believe?
Did I not say that many will come in My Name but few with speak with My Voice?

There are fewer than twenty who have permission to impart to the world the Word of God and this includes those who are given divine messages from Heaven by My beloved Mother.

Many other seers are also present in the world but their mission is different.

Their role can be one of daily prayer to help save humanity or one of personal suffering, offered up as a gift to Me, to save souls from Satan. Suffering in this way, willingly, crushes the power of Satan over many men's souls.
My prophets are few and you will know them by My true Voice which will strike the hearts and souls of God's children in a way which is impossible to ignore.
My messages to the world for these times will be detailed and will unveil truths not revealed before. Much of what I give you now is simply to remind you of My Teachings.
Much of what I present to you now is the food of life, given to you through My Crusade Prayers, to help save your souls and those of others at My Second Coming.
Many other messages given to others will be similar but will not go into as much detail. Their missions are just as important as they will convert souls.
Always remember this. I am trying to show you how much I love you and wish to reveal the Truth of My existence. The proof of this will at last be revealed to all of God's children soon.
Please do not fight amongst each other trying to outdo each other in terms of your spiritual knowledge. The Truth is this.
No man knows the Truth contained in the Seals hidden in the Book of Revelation.

As I have told you before, they were sealed up, in the Book of Truth, until now, the end times.

I, Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, now open these to prepare you for My New Kingdom.

You have been given the Holy Scripture to prepare you and now you must allow Me, the King of all Mankind, to tell you the Truth of what is to come.
By doing this I will be able to lead you through what will be a minefield of deceit, persecution and hatred.

Allow Me, all of you, including all members of My Church on Earth, to bring you over these last hurdles to Eternal Life.

My Church must trust Me. They must remove their shackles of fear and doubt and allow Me make myself known through these messages.
Recognise My Love in its pure and simple form.

My Love is not sophisticated and shrouded in mystical syllables.

It is plain for you to see but full of such compassion that it will cut through you like a flame of recognition when you drop your armour of pride and fear.

When you do this it will become easier for you to follow me, Your Jesus. I came as Saviour the first time.
I come, once again, as Saviour this last time. Only this time My task is even heavier. The Love of God has died in the world. It is only a flicker.
Were My Second Coming to take place now few would enter Paradise.

The Warning, My Gift of My Divine Mercy will help convert most of humanity.

Help Me prepare My flock. I need My Church on earth, both clergy and laity, to help Me save all of God's children. Please accept My Hand as I reach out and stretch My Call to all nations.
Come with Me, your beloved Jesus. Follow Me this time.
Do not reject me like the Pharisees did.
