Give me a sign so that my heart can respond to You.

Fill my empty soul with the Grace that I need to open my mind and my heart to Your Love.

Have Mercy on me, and cleanse my soul from every wrongdoing, that I have committed in my life.

Forgive me for rejecting You, but please fill me with the love that I need, to be made worthy of Eternal Life.

Help me to know You, to see Your Presence in other people and fill me with the Grace to recognise the Sign of God in every beautiful Gift, which You have given the human race.
Help me to understand Your Ways and save me from the separation and the pain of darkness that I feel in my soul. Amen.

Crusade Prayer (166) To mitigate the murder of innocents

Dearest Mother of Salvation, please present this, our plea to mitigate the murder of innocents, to your beloved Son, Jesus Christ. We ask, that in His Mercy, He will remove the threat of genocide, persecution and terror against God's children, in every form.
Please, we implore you, dear Mother of Salvation, to hear our cries for love, unity and peace in this sorrowful world.

We ask that Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, will protect all of us during these times of great pain and suffering on earth. Amen.

"The family, borne out of the love of God, will always be attacked by evil. To protect your family from the evil one please recite this Crusade Prayer."
 O God, my Eternal Father, through the grace of Your beloved Son, Jesus Christ, please protect my family, at all times, from evil. Give us the strength to rise above evil intent and to remain unified in our love for You and one another.
Sustain us through every trial and suffering we may endure and keep alive the love we have for each other so that we are in union with Jesus.
Bless our families and give us the Gift of Love, even in times of strife.

Strengthen our love, so that we may share the joy of our family with others so that Your Love may be shared with the whole world. Amen.
Remember that God created each one of you in His Likeness so that He could create the perfect family. Be thankful for your families for it is one of the greatest Gifts He has bestowed upon the human race. When the suffering on this earth comes to an end, and when hatred is obliterated, God will unite humanity as one in Him. You will become whole again and His Family will have Eternal Life.
