They will join together in unison to proclaim My Word so that every lost soul can be grasped from the clutches of the beast.

My Remnant Church will gather quickly and grow through the world and prayer will knit them together as one Holy Church.
I will send help to each of My two Churches, My Two Witnesses on earth. Then they will rise and with courage proclaim the Truth in every corner of the world.
My Voice, will peal like thunder and those who truly love Me will not fail to recognise Me.

The graces of the Holy Spirit will fire the souls of My soldiers and they will march forth and help Me save humanity. Rejoice My Army for you are blessed to have been chosen for this glorious task.
Through your love for Me, your Divine Saviour, you will help save your poor brothers and sisters from being lost to the evil one.

Come now My followers and allow me to lead you through the dense and thorny jungle into the Light of My New Kingdom on earth.
Never fear My Hand as I now lead you fearlessly into the battle against the antichrist.

Remember this is a war which will be won by My Remnant Church on earth.

Also remember that the number of souls which can be salvaged will depend on the strength of your Faith, your generosity of spirit and your willingness to suffer in My Holy Name.
I love you.

I bless you.

I give you the graces you need now to pick up your armour and march to Eternal Life. Your Beloved Jesus

The test of an authentic prophet lies in the prayers given to them for humanity.

My dearly beloved daughter know that I would never condemn those who say they come in My Name, but who don't. I love all of God's children including the false prophets sent to confuse humanity at this time.
Many such souls are full of love for Me and feel a need to become closer. They can, through no fault of their own, imagine they are receiving divine messages. You must pray for such souls. You must never judge them.
Then there are those who say they come in My Name but who wear the badge of the beast. Wolves in sheep's clothing, they set out to snare the pure souls and stain them with the sin of deception.
These are the dangerous false prophets whose goal is to twist the truth of My Teachings in such a way that they do not appear noticeable.
They will, through an external façade of false humility, have you believe a lie in My Name. They will present a tolerant mask of deceit and you will be convinced that they are spreading the Truth.
The test of an authentic prophet lies in the prayers given to them for humanity.

Conversion spreads quickly by the Power of the Holy Spirit when messages come from Heaven and they cover all religions, all faiths to unite them as one.
I urge for prayer at this time for such souls who have been deceived to believe they speak with the voice from Heaven. Pray for them so that they will be given the strength to seek humility in order to allow them to see the Truth.
Pray that they will not allow their souls to be used by the deceiver to cause confusion among God's children.

Pray, too, for those who do not speak in the name of God but who knowingly speak with the tongue of Satan. They also need your prayers for they are being used mercilessly by Satan as a means to spread lies.
Your beloved Jesus
