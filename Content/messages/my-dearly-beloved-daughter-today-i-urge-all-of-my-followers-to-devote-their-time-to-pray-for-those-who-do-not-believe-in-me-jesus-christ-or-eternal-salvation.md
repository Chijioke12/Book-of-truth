These souls are close to My heart and are the ones who need to be converted so that they can be saved first. Those who are blind cannot see that their life does not end on earth.
Many do not accept that they will exist for eternity.

These souls wound Me deeply and I feel terror as I watch them destroy the life in their souls in this life on earth. Even The Warning will not convert many of them who proclaim to be atheists.
Their only salvation is through the prayers and suffering of victim souls.

I urge you to prayer for these souls through this Crusade Prayer (41) For the souls of Non-Believers
