The insults thrown at Him have been ignored by Him.

Instead He wants to bring His children back to Him, not through fear, but through the love of those children of His who love Him the most.
He relies on those of you with a deep abiding love for Him and me, His Son, to help gather His lost children so He can take them to Him.
Bring all those souls close to your heart and place them now before the Throne of My Father and, in His Mercy, He will give you the greatest Gift of all.
He will grant their salvation.

Bring the names of dark souls, including a list of those not known to you, and beg for mercy for their souls. My Father awaits, with love in His Heart, for your generous response.
Come. Do not hesitate, for this is the most extraordinary Gift of its kind from Heaven. You of this generation are, indeed, blessed.
Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: Embrace the Gift of the Grace of Immunity children. Cherish it for it is a rare Gift from Heaven.
Saturday, August 25th, 2012 @ 12:00

My child Heaven rejoices. The Choirs of Angels are singing at the top of their voices in praise of my Father.

His Glorious Mercy, bestowed by Him, through the special Grace of Immunity, is being acclaimed with great love and joy by all the angels and saints in Heaven.
My children do not, as yet, understand the significance of this great Gift of Mercy by The Father, God the Most High. You, my children, now have the power to save the others, the lost souls.
This means that the power of the evil one can be conquered in a way, which was not possible up to now.

The lies, the deceit and the hatred which the evil one plants in the minds of God's children can be rendered useless if the prayers given to those who love my Son are presented before the Throne of my Father.
Embrace the Gift of the Grace of Immunity children. Cherish it for it is a rare Gift from Heaven.
It proves to you the Love of your Father for each of His beloved children.

It is one of the great miracles, presented to all of God's children in the end times.
Thank you for responding to my call. Mary, Queen of Heaven.
Mother of Salvation

Hatred is the cause of all evil in the world and it takes many forms.
Sunday, August 26th, 2012 @ 18:30

My dearly beloved daughter, hatred is the cause of all evil in the world and it takes many forms. Hostility towards another person springs from fear, the fear that this person may hurt you in some way.
Disagreements with another person can come about because of the sin of pride. This is when you feel that you must prove your worth, at all costs, even if you are wrong.
Jealousy very soon turns to hatred although it can be mild to begin with.

Dislike of oneself begins because you compare your life with others whom you feel have better fortune than you.

Very soon this dislike develops into hatred of oneself and one's body. This then leads into sins of the flesh. Hatred may also develop because of the sin of coveting another's possessions.
This can lead to war when one country covets the riches of another.

Or it can mean allowing greed to consume your soul when you crave the same worldly riches as your neighbour.

Envy also turns into a form of hatred especially when, no matter how hard you try to emulate another, you fail to achieve what you set out to do.
All sins, if allowed to fester, can lead you towards hatred.

When you feel hatred you must know that Satan has managed to invade your spirit. When this happens he will hold you in a vice-like grip and will not leave you alone.
No matter how much you try to release his grip, he will hold onto you for dear life. Your only weapon is prayer.

Pray, pray, pray when hatred surges through you. For until it leaves you, you can never feel peace, love or joy again. When hatred takes hold of your heart and soul, you become one step further removed from Me, your Jesus.
You suffer terribly and feel an anger and a helplessness which you cannot control.

Never believe the final lie which Satan will plant in your soul, when he has cast a cloak of hatred over you.

The lie is this. Your hatred can only be dissipated when you seek final revenge on the target of your hatred. What to do when hatred envelops you? The power of love can evaporate hatred, instantly.
When you pray and ask me to help you My answer will be this.

Forgive your adversaries and those whom you believe are the cause of your hatred. But to forgive you must humble yourself before Me and ask Me to forgive you first. Once you forgive those you hate you must then atone for your sin.
Show your adversaries love. Fight hatred, a wicked and dangerous disease of the soul, with love. Love is the cure to rid your soul of this infestation.
When you can do this you will have defeated Satan and he will leave you be. Never be afraid to fight hatred in your soul even though you will find it very difficult.
If hatred could be diluted in this way, through the humility of the sinner, peace would reign in the world. Your Jesus

This is the responsibility I give you My Disciples, to convert the souls for whom I yearn the most
Monday, August 27th, 2012 @ 19:20

My dearly beloved daughter My Love for My disciples, who have responded to My Messages, has swelled My Sacred Heart to such proportions that it will now burst forth with an abundance of Graces.
My Graces pour over you My beloved followers at this time.

They are being given to you to strengthen your resolve to spread My Holy Word.

My Messages from Heaven will nourish souls, including the most blackened, with the oxygen they need to survive the darkness poured out over the world by Satan.
His invisible, but powerful, influence, weakens even the strongest of believers who begin to doubt their faith.

When I give you these Graces I do so for a reason.

You, My disciples, are the anchor from which all souls who wander aimlessly in confusion, will draw towards. Even if they will not listen to you in the beginning you must persevere.
Give them copies of My Messages and My Crusade Prayers and walk away silently.

They will be touched in some way by My Holy Spirit. If they do not accept them they will find it difficult to simply walk away and just forget them. No, they will come back for Me.
Some will come back reluctantly. Curiosity will get the better of them.

Some will come back with a view to try to dismiss these Messages and try to convince you to do the same. Others will come back to argue with you, sneer at you and challenge you.
Others will tell you that these Words do not come from Me and this will break your hearts.

But then there will be the converts. Those who will come running to you with pure joy in their hearts begging for more. It will be these souls who will make it all worthwhile.
However it is the dark souls for whom you must pray the most and it is because of them that I pour out My Graces upon you so that you will help salvage their souls.For without your help there is no hope for them.
This is the responsibility I give you My Disciples, to convert the souls for whom I yearn the most. Your Jesus

If you praise false gods and ask for great wealth, riches and other gifts, purely to satisfy your lusts you will attract the Prince of Darkness
Tuesday, August 28th, 2012 @ 19:30

My dearly beloved daughter the world and the people who live in it are in denial. They do not believe in the True God, My Eternal Father.
They, in their billions, run around in confusion and chase down blind alleys seeking a god they can pay allegiance to.

The problem about the gods, the false gods they put on a pedestal, is that these idols are of their own making. Their own creation made to suit their interpretation of who God should be.
These gods, and My daughter they have created hundreds of them, are formed out of their own imaginations.

These same gods only serve one purpose and that is to massage the expectations, borne out of self-love, as to what their ideal god should be.
The gods they create are elaborate. They appeal to their sense of the divine right of their souls. These souls believe that their self- made gods promote their rights to wondrous things.
To those of you who do not accept the Truth, the Existence of the one True God, know this. Only the True Creator of humanity can give you free will.
My Father will never force you or command you to do anything for this is impossible.

When you ask false gods to give you riches, make you successful or when you seek favours you are being selfish.

Only when you ask God to grant you gifts, according to His Holy Will, can you really communicate with the one True God.

If you praise false gods and ask for great wealth, riches and other gifts, purely to satisfy your lusts you will attract the Prince of Darkness.
He is waiting for the moment when he will grant you such favours. Do not open the door to the King of Lies for it will come at a great price.
He will exchange such worldly gifts in return for your soul. Your Jesus

Good versus evil is a battle between God, My Eternal Father and Satan. It is that simple.
Wednesday, August 29th, 2012 @ 23:00

My dearly beloved daughter the battle begins now.

For every grievous law passed by nations, which oppose the Laws of God, the forces of punishment will lash down upon them by the Hand of My Father.
Every evil offense, carried out in defiance of the Laws of God, will be attacked and nations will suffer for their sins.

Just as the Mercy of God is great and will cover the widest possible breadth in order to salvage souls so, too, will the punishment of God be unleashed to stop the spread of evil.
Good versus evil is a battle between God, My Eternal Father and Satan. It is that simple. Those who follow the Laws of God will be upheld.
Those, for whom they pray and offer personal sacrifice in atonement for their sins, will be dealt with leniently.

Those who refuse to follow God, despite knowing the Truth, and who infest other souls through the wicked laws they lay down amongst their nations, will be punished.
There will be many storms, floods and earthquakes ahead.

For each insult against God will be met with fierce resistance so that, in time, the purification will be and can be fulfilled.

Never forget love for God must come from the heart. Deny the Word of God and you will suffer for this.
Love for God must be pure. Fear of God is a natural part of the affinity for the Majesty of the Creator of all things and is part of this love.
Respect for God's Laws must be shown.

When the respect is absent and when man flouts the Laws of God which corrupt humanity, the Anger of My Father will be unleashed.
Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: The awakening is coming soon
Thursday, August 30th, 2012 @ 18:15

My child the renewal of souls has already begun and the Era of Peace is not too far away.

As all of God's children are being blessed by the Gift of the Word of my beloved and precious Son, the spread of the Holy Spirit continues to spread across all nations.
There will be no stopping the Word of my Son for this is by the command of My Father.

Conversion will ignite the hearts of humanity and many will feel the Love of God, their natural Father, grip them in such a way that it will surprise and shock them.
Once this Divine Love surges through them they will feel an urge to shout for joy for it is like no other love known to man. The awakening is coming soon.
As the Spirit of God continues to fan out in Flames of Glory, evil will be diluted and Satan's army will be left bereft of its soldiers. It will be left defenceless because many of his followers will be won over by God's Mercy, leaving Satan with only half an army. Disillusioned with his empty promises they will respond to the Light of my Son's Divine Mercy.
The battle has not only begun but souls are now following my Son in their multitudes as they seek out the Truth of Eternal Life. I bless you my child.
Heaven rejoices because of the conversion of souls and the salvation of dark souls, which is being achieved through the prayers of those who love my Son.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

No man knows the Truth of the real contents of the Book of Revelation. Only God knows
Friday, August 31st, 2012 @ 23:20

My dearly beloved daughter you are at the cusp of an explosion, which will see My Mercy pour out over the world in an event, which will change the face of the earth.
This mission has been quick.

You were called suddenly and with haste as I moved to ensure that the world was given the Truth.

So few people understand that this is how God calls on the prophets, unawares, leaving no time for preparation on the part of the prophet.
This means that the words flow without hesitation.

No man has the ability to write such Messages as these. To say that this is the case is an insult to My Father and the Holy Spirit. No man could, through human words, ignite the Flame of God's Love in the souls of His children like these Messages can.
Only God could produce such a result.

No man knows the Truth of the real contents of the Book of Revelation. Only God knows.

Only I, the Lamb of God, have the authority to reveal what they contain. I do this now through My messenger Maria Divine Mercy who will convey My Words, not hers, to a disbelieving world.
Heed My Word now for it is being given to you to save you. To warn you. To prepare you. And to purify you. Be ready when the time comes.
I come, through the Messages, to prepare you. You do not know the day or the hour; so therefore, you must prepare your soul as if the time for Me to come is in the next day.
Always be ready. I ask that you keep a clear and open mind when reading My Messages for the first time, for this will probably be the only time you will witness My Voice from Heaven until the day you have all been waiting for arrives.
I bless you all.

I beckon you to come to Me.

When I ask you to pray I simply ask you to confide in Me, in your own simple words.

In your own way. In your private thoughts. I hear everything. I see all. I feel what you feel. I am with each of you standing beside you, just waiting for the day when you will finally surrender to My Call.
You have nothing to fear from Me for My Love for you will overcome any darkness, which keeps you distant from Me. Turn to Me and I will pour My Light over you.
Then I will give you the peace you crave. I am waiting. I am patient. Come to Me when you are ready.
I love you. I bless you.

Your Saviour

Jesus Christ

This Mission is the last Gift of Prophecy sanctioned by My Father to save souls
Saturday, September 1st, 2012 @ 10:25

My dearly beloved daughter, the speed at which My Messages are being given to humanity is indicative of the urgency of this Mission.
So many people in the world are lost.

So many poor souls do not know who God, My Father, is.

So many do not accept Me, His beloved Son, as the True Messiah.

This Mission is the last Gift of Prophecy sanctioned by My Father to save souls.

These Messages are for Christians, Jews, Muslims, atheists, agnostic and all those who seek solace in man-made religions. All people, all souls, have the same desire to find meaning in their lives.
For most it is heart breaking if they do not believe in God, for they believe that all ends when their life on earth expires.

Oh if only they could see what happens when their souls come before Me. They see Me and are speechless for they cannot believe that I am real. The joy in many such souls is matched only by relief if they die in a State of Grace.
However, the joy of those souls in darkness, when they see Me, is cut short and they drift away from Me, into the depths of Hell in a state of shock and despair.
Those souls who know of God's Teachings, through His prophets and as a result of My own Mission on earth, and who reject Me, know this.
You have chosen to turn your back on the Truth. Because of My Love for you I will do all I can to open your eyes.

I will bring gifts and because of My Great Mercy I will save you. I call on all of you, irrespective, as to which religion you follow, to listen to these Words now.
You all know what it is like to be part of a family.

Some of you are fortunate enough to have been born into a family full of love.

Others are not so blessed and may have suffered through difficulties and darkness within the family unit. Others are lost, bruised, angry and cannot feel true love for their families.
Some are cast out into the wilderness to fend for themselves with no one to turn to.

Many simply need a crutch of some sort to lean on in order to feel hope. This is why many poor souls try to find religions, which provide that missing link.
Sadly this simply leads them into further despair. For these religions are based on a lie.

Lies hurt you children. They give you a false sense of security. These religions have no substance because they do not follow the Truth, the path of the Lord.
Just know that We, the Holy Trinity, are your family. The New Heaven and Earth will be your true home. Follow Me on the path of Truth so I can take you to your rightful home.
A home so full of love and joy that it is all you need strive for.

Please open your eyes because the time has come for the world to be finally present with the Covenant of Truth. My Death on the Cross was a Covenant to bring you salvation.
My Second Coming is also a Covenant, the final Covenant, to bring you home to God, the Creator of all things. My Father, God the Most High, is now sending Me soon to bring Salvation to all of His children.
I can only do this and fulfil My Father's Promise if I can save every soul. Do not block My Path because of doubts.

Do not reject My attempts to bring salvation to every soul.

Do not forfeit the chance to live a fulfilled life full of love, joy and wonder, in peace and harmony, in the New Era of Peace. Your Jesus

I call on all of you to set up centres where you can ensure that My Messages are spread
Monday, September 3rd, 2012 @ 10:08

My dearly beloved daughter the army has been formed and its ranks will spread across Christian countries as well as those run by Communists.
No country will be left untouched by My army, My Remnant Army.

There will be tiers within My army with ranks of every kind designed to ensure that My Mission to convert souls succeeds. All those in My army, irrespective of the role they play, will have this in common with each other.
They will serve Me in humble servitude and their love for Me, their Jesus, will stay alight throughout the Mission. The Torch of Flames, ignited by the Holy Spirit, will not flicker for this is a special Gift to strengthen My soldiers.
Remember this will be a war, a war to save the human race. A war, which My Father will ensure is won in the Name of God. I call on all of you to set up centres where you can to ensure that My Messages are spread in whatever way you can.
Prayer is an important part of such centres because when you set up prayer groups you will strengthen the power of My army. I will increase conversion as more prayer groups are established in My Holy Name.
Call these prayer groups Jesus to Mankind and leave the rest to Me.

My Holy Spirit will cover you in such groups and guide you every step of the way. I will give you further instructions soon. Be at peace. I am happy that you, My beloved disciples have responded to My Call with such love and trust.
Your Jesus

My Name is no longer revered. My Name is cursed
Tuesday, September 4th, 2012 @ 23:05

My dearly beloved daughter, the pain of rejection and the hatred of humanity is felt by Me every moment of each day. It never eases. My Crucifixion was only the beginning.
It may have heralded the salvation of mankind, but My pain will continue until Satan is banished.

While he is present and reigns over the earth, which he does still at this time, My pain and torment is never ending. The only relief is the joy I feel when I see real love present in the world of pure souls towards each other.
It is this love, which keeps the Light between night and day possible. For without My Light, darkness would prevail twenty-four hours a day.
Imagine if you will, My pain.

For those among you, who suffer pain and hurt by the hands of those you love, you will know exactly what My pain is like. When you are tormented cruelly, both mentally and physically, by someone you love, the pain is harder to bear.
Even if you know that the person who persecutes you is in terrible darkness, it does not ease your pain. If anything, it increases the intensity and severity of your suffering.
This is because you still care about your tormentors but you know that they suffer and cannot help their behaviour.

So much darkness are they in, when you try to explain to them what they have to do in order to get rid of their darkness they will not listen.
They don't want to listen.

Nor do they want to rejuvenate their spirit in order to see the light, the love and the joy they would feel if only they would listen to you, the one person who truly loves them despite their faults, their one chance to reject this dangerous dark cloud, which covers their whole spirit, to set them free.
The pain of rejection is hard for Me, your Saviour, the Son of Man.

I suffered a terrible physical suffering, much of which was not given to the world in every detail; so horrible was the torture, for I did not want this kind of sympathy.
No, I just sought your loyalty, your faith as well as the joy and relief of your knowing that you were saved from eternal damnation. But does humanity really know of the Gift I have given them really?
Many to go Mass, or receive the wine at other Christian Churches to honour My Gift but they do not understand what this means.

I gave Myself completely in Body, Mind and Soul. When you receive Communion you must consume My Body fully and not just say you honour Me.
For without My Body, My Real Presence, I cannot capture your souls. Don't you know this?

Why do you reject My genuine Gift in the way it was explained to My Apostles? That The Eucharist is indeed My Body?

You cannot imagine the graces, which have been lost to you, your families and generations because of your dismissal of the Power of such a Gift.
My pain never goes away. I weep. I suffer. I cry when I witness sin so rampant in the world that My Name is no longer revered. My Name is cursed. I feel intense pain.
You, My daughter, have been given this same pain for the last few months. I allowed this assault on you by the evil one to infiltrate you. This sacrifice, offered by you for Me, as a victim soul, was difficult but you learned one simple lesson through it.
When you are the victim of such cruel suffering at the hands of others, in My Name, you feel the very pain I am feeling at the same time.
Our pain is entwined My daughter in this mystical union. You accepted My Call to become a victim soul willingly, knowing the consequences, frightening though it was, in order to save souls.

Now that you bring conversion, you know that when suffering is required it is to match My own suffering, which is and can be very traumatic and hurtful.
Because of your human nature you will, from time to time, tend to struggle and fight against the horror being inflicted upon you especially when even the pain of nails, being hammered into your wrists, would be preferable to the torment you have been asked to endure in My Name.
My Graces helped you in your submission to these requests of suffering. They granted you a strength, which allowed you to rise, stand high and praise God. For these are graces to help you accept suffering as Gift to God to save souls in mortal sin.
The next time someone torments you, treats you cruelly and mentally abuses you children if you could remember this then you will overcome your pain.
Say to Me this Crusade Prayer (75) I assign My Pain to You dear Jesus

Jesus I assign my pain and suffering to that which You suffered during Your Agony on Calvary. For every abuse and verbal onslaught I suffer I offer it in honour of Your Crowning of Thorns.
For every unfair criticism of me I offer it in honour of Your humiliation in front of Pilate.

For every physical torment I endure at the hands of others I offer it in honour of Your Scourging at the Pillar.

For every insult I endure I offer it up in honour of the terrible physical torture You endured during the Crowning of Thorns when they tore out Your Eye.
For every time I imitate You, impart Your Teachings and when I am sneered at in Your Name let me help You on the road to Calvary.
Help me to be rid of pride and never to be afraid to admit that I love You dear Jesus.

Then when all seems hopeless in my life dear Jesus help me to be brave by remembering how You willingly allowed Yourself to be Crucified in such a vile and cruel way.
Help me to stand up and be counted as a true Christian, a true soldier in Your army, humble and contrite in my heart, in remembrance of the Sacrifice You made for me.
Hold my hand dear Jesus and show me how my own suffering can inspire others to join Your army with like-minded souls who love You.
Help me to accept suffering and to offer it up to You as a gift to save souls in the final battle against the tyranny of the evil one. Amen.
Suffering My daughter, difficult as it is, is a Gift, which I use by handing it over to those I trust in My Heart so that I can save souls. You My daughter have eased My suffering greatly by your response. It will take some time however before I am free of the Cross. This can only come about when I save every possible soul alive on the earth today.
Your Jesus

A great clash will become apparent and man will separate from man. Brother against brother
Wednesday, September 5th, 2012 @ 14:30

My dearly beloved daughter nation after nation is going through a transition right now. Not one nation can fail to understand that much change is in the air.
Not only do the laws, which govern their countries, begin to change, but the faith they once had seems to have evaporated. Fewer priests, fewer servants in My Christian Church, are coming forward to defend the Laws of God.
Nor do they shout their allegiance to Me. Instead their voices are but whispers amidst the noise of voices, which rant and promote self-love.
The Word of God is being devoured by the voices of the atheists who disguise their voices behind the cloak of government laws, which are being amended in the name of so called Justice, tolerance, for the good of all.
The lies being presented before you are designed to destroy not only the Word of My Father, but Christianity throughout the world. The apostasy has spread like wildfire and has almost reached breaking point.
This is the time for the intervention of God. Enough lies.

The King of Lies deceives God's children everywhere. Do not follow your governments who proclaim the Word of God to be a lie. Do not accept new laws, which condone mortal sin. Fight, all of you. Stand up for what is right.
Do not allow laws, promoted by the King of Lies, to grasp you and your families into a bottomless pit.

Should you allow laws, which ban the practice of your faith, you will suffer. Your souls will lack nourishment and you will become distant from Me.
But should you accept murder and abortion and not stand up against such evil, then your country will be punished by the Hand of God.
While the apostasy continues to spread everywhere, conversion is on the other hand growing and soon the two will collide head on.
A great clash will become apparent and man will separate from man. Brother against brother. Neighbour against neighbour. There will be two camps. Those who love God and those who don't.
I will give every soul the chance to decide which camp they wish to become part of, in the hope that they will choose Me, their beloved Saviour.
You My disciples, through your prayers, especially the recital of the Litany of the Grace of Immunity, can bring more souls to Me. Then I will snatch the good into My Bosom as foretold and in the blink of an eye they will be taken to safety.
My Promise is to save mankind.

But the final choice will be down to each soul through their own free will. Your Jesus

My Word is being digested quietly by My leading servants
Thursday, September 6th, 2012 @ 18:30

My dearly beloved daughter My Church on Earth is, at last, recognising that I now communicate to the world through you, the seventh messenger.
My Word is being digested quietly by My leading servants who will not, however, publicly proclaim that these Words come from My Holy Lips.
They know that they come from Me and I have touched their hearts and lifted their souls so that they will now follow My lead. So many sacred servants of Mine have now sought My Words to humanity at this time.
They need My special graces now, as without these they would be unable to lead My flock with real confidence.

My Holy Spirit is being poured over My local sacred servants so that they will find the strength to lead My Church through the thorny thick jungle, which lies ahead.
Never fear My beloved clergy for I will never desert you.

You will feel My Presence in the times you face ahead when My Body, My Church, will be persecuted.

This Holy Presence will be your mainstay, as you will need all My help to sustain you in leading God's children towards their rightful inheritance.
I accept that many of you will not speak out. I understand how difficult it will be for you to openly proclaim My Word given to you through My end time prophet. But know this.
You have a responsibility to God's children to lead and direct them to the Truth. You must never accept lies in lieu of the Truth.
You know that the Truth of My Teachings is cast in stone. My Teachings have, and never will, change.
My New Revelations, which are contained in the Seals in the Book of Revelation, will be made known to you shortly. Trust in Me.
Accept that I speak with you now for I would never forsake you at this time.

My duty to My Father is to ensure that the world is prepared adequately for My Return to salvage every single child of God. Your Jesus

This Mission can be likened to the rescue of a gigantic ocean liner
Friday, September 7th, 2012 @ 20:35

My dearly beloved daughter you must never feel that you work alone in this Mission even though it feels like this.

You must know that many people the world over are listening to My Holy Word and that My Messages are saving souls. This Mission can be likened to the rescue of a gigantic ocean liner.
Many souls are being warned of danger and told, in advance, of the rescue plan.

If they listen they will not only save themselves but the lives of their families and friends.

Many will not listen and say: "What danger?" They will not accept the life rafts because they do not believe the ship will sink.

No, they say, this is a false warning, a false alarm. As the time will draw close and the final days become apparent they will scramble everywhere looking for a place of safety.
They will run and hide from the explosion, when the mountains will sink into the seas and when the sky will turn like blood but they will not escape.
Those sinners who commit terrible grievances against My Father and who know how black their souls are will be lost.

They, who sided with the Beast, will at that stage try to escape his clutches. For it will only be then that the Truth will finally dawn on them and the Light will not be their right.
Only the darkness will ease their pain and, yet, it will also bring them relentless terror and suffering.

Never reject the help you need to prepare your souls. You must accept that the wickedness in the world has to be eradicated.

Those sinners, who refuse to change, even after they have been given the Truth of the Word of God, will not survive the final battle.
They will be thrown into the lake of fire with the beast and that will not be the end of their suffering. It will only be the beginning. To those who sneer at My attempts to prepare your souls you will be given every chance to turn to Me.
Every attempt will be made to save you. If you do not accept My Hand, the life raft you need to keep you afloat, you will drown in sorrow.
Only the prayers of others can save you. The earth looks like it has done for centuries. The skies look the same.
The sun shines like it has always done.

The moon looms on a clear night and man still gasps in wonder at the Creation of God. But changes have already begun and to those who are alert I say this.
You know and you sense the change. Do your duty and use prayer so that the eyes of mankind will be opened to the Truth and that the hearts of all will be opened up to the Love of God.
It will be the Love of God for all His children and the response of His children to His Call that the human race can be saved. Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: There is a wonderful future ahead for all of God's children
Saturday, September 8th, 2012 @ 15:30

My child let all of God's children sit down quietly and allow His Light to shine through their souls.

It is important to put time aside in perfect silence in order to ponder on the Love of God and the plan of my Son to save humanity.

There is a wonderful future ahead for all of God's children and this New Era of Peace will be welcomed by all those fortunate enough to enter the gates.
Until that day comes, every effort will be made by the evil one to cause disruption and hatred in the world. He and his demons are creating division amongst God's children.
They encourage murder, abortion, hatred, violence, persecution and war in every part of the world.

They will not rest until they ensnare every weak soul who succumbs to the temptation they place before such souls, to sin against the Lord God, God the Most High.
So many souls have allowed themselves to be taken, unawares, into their dark prison from which there is little escape once there. Once the evil one wins over a soul he does not stop until he completely infests the poor soul.
Sin, therefore, is to be avoided for no sin is of little consequence. All it takes is one temptation and the soul becomes weak and defenceless.
Pray, pray, pray against the war which is being waged by the evil one against God's children.

When someone sins against you, even though you are an innocent victim, you must not allow yourself to be forced to retaliate through sin for this is what the evil one wants.
He pits one soul against another in the hope that hatred will fester between the two.

Be on your guard every day and never forget the protection that my Holy Rosary offers against Satan.

I encourage all souls, all religions, to recite my Holy Rosary every day. When you do this the evil one will avoid you and leave you for he cannot withstand the pain he endures when My Rosary is recited especially when said aloud.
Go in peace. Remember I am the Mother of all humanity.

I am the Mother of Salvation. My protection must be sought out by God's children. By asking for my help, and prayers, many graces will be accorded to you.
Mother of God Mother of Salvation

True love comes from God.

My dearly beloved daughter when you doubt the Love of God you doubt the existence of true love. All you are left with is a flawed love.
True love comes from God. When a person does not love God enough they are incapable of loving another human being in the fullness of true love.
Only those with the fire of God's Love in their souls can truly convey the true meaning of love in another person. The same is true for those in a marriage that is blessed in My Church.
The Love of God, which will shine down upon the marriage of a man and a woman, who love each other, will infiltrate their souls if they love God with an abandonment, which is necessary to feel peace.
True love means peace. Without love there is no peace no matter how much you try to find it. Peace can only come about through the love of one person for another.
When love is missing in your life nothing is balanced and, in its place is a feeling of numbness. To find love you must find room in your heart for God.
To find God you must accept Me, your Jesus, as His Beloved Son. For, if you will allow Me, I will take you to Him.
When I do and when His Light invades your soul you will find it easy to love another person. The Love of God, present in a soul, will open the heart of another.
Love shines through heartbreak, unrest and disruption in the world. It is the only way to achieve peace, not only in your personal lives, but in the world around you.
Love brings peace but it must stem from a real love for God, your Creator. Peace brings harmony.
Love is the lifeline of the human race and, without it, you are lost, lonely, hungry and you will never find peace. Your Jesus
