This is not the time to fall down and weep. It is the time to fight for your salvation.

I call on all Christian Churches, My clergy and all those who have devoted their lives to Me, their Jesus, to hear My pleas. Never forsake the truth of My teachings.
Never forsake Me.

Never forsake My Church. For I am the Church. Never forsake My Body, for I am the Bread of life.
Never accept the lies, soon to be implanted among you, to displace My Church on earth. It is time to prepare.
Soon you will be made to swallow a new religion which will be manmade.

Soon you will be force fed what will seem like the Holy Eucharist but it will not be My Body. It will become empty, barren and will yield no real life.
The only Holy Eucharist that exists is the way in which My Presence is made known in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass as it is now.
Never deviate from this even if you are forced to do so by the heathen who will take over My Christian Churches. They will desecrate My Churches and turn them into nothing more than places of entertainment and social outlets. You must always follow the steps I taught My Apostles at the Last Supper.
Now you must ensure that all is in place before the attack begins.

For soon you will find it impossible to follow a false doctrine imposed on you by the abomination that lies ahead.

The False Prophet will not only take over the Catholic Church he will dictate over all Christian Churches which he will merge as one.
But it will not be I, Jesus Christ that the New Temple will be built upon. It will be a temple, to replace the Holy See, to honour the beast.
Heed now My words for you will soon see the Truth.

To those brave enough to stand up to this persecution of your faith you must plan now.

To those who do not have the strength to fight the reign of the antichrist and the false prophet drop down on your knees now and beg Me to help you.
I will guide you through My new leaders who will spring up among you led by My Two Witnesses.

Enoch and Elijah, present in My Christian Churches on earth and the House of Israel, will influence the preaching's of the Gospels all over the world soon.
Nothing will stop the teaching of the Truth.

This time will be difficult but rise and follow My Army on earth and more souls will be saved. Do not forsake the flock that I have given over to you to lead.
Fear not because only by following My Path to Eternal Life can you be saved.

Follow the path of the False Prophet and not only will you become lost to Me but you will lead innocent souls towards the pathway to Hell.

Be brave My sacred servants.

Accept that the time for My return is imminent. You do not have time to waste. Your Jesus

Mother of Salvation: Pray for Christian Churches so they will be given the graces to defend their Faith.
