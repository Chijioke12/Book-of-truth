So many children are there of Mine, scattered throughout the world, yet so few know their Father. Their Creator. For those who do not know Me they must be told that I will not forsake them.
I will rise against the evil forces and the king of lies, the beast, and wipe this terrible scourge out of existence. Only when the scales of wickedness have been pulled back can My children see the Truth.
Children do not worry because your prayers are touching My Heart and through your requests, I will salvage many of My children who are in the dark.
My mission to send My Beloved Son, to claim My Kingdom, is well established now, although many may not be aware of this.

The time of My son is being merged with your time children and soon all will become one.

The time for the New Paradise has been fixed and all has been laid down for My children's new home, the new world. I call to you from Heaven to urge you to trust in My Son, His great Mercy and His promise to fulfil this covenant.
Surrender any doubts which may linger as they are blocking you from seeking true peace.

They block My Graces which I want to pour over you to protect you from the last remaining period when Satan controls the earth. His time is about to end. Then the new beginning will evolve.
I await, with love, the return of My children into My Kingdom, the Kingdom of the New Paradise. It is what was meant to be. I love you. Trust in My Son and await My Call.
Your Father
God the Most High

Mother of God: It has been foretold, my child, that in these times you live now that the hearts of mankind will be hardened.
Friday, September 21st, 2012 @ 15:05

My child, how quick mankind is to idolise false kings, false gods.

Many people in the world today think nothing of embracing false idols and then have no guilt in their hearts when the reject the one true God.
It has been foretold, my child, that in these times you live now that the hearts of mankind will be hardened. They will reject even their own family in pursuit of pleasure.
They will reject those in poverty and those who starve as they practice every kind of self-interest and commit the sin of gluttony.

These days are upon you children. As the human race wanders helplessly, in confusion, where nothing satisfies, they will grasp at anything which they believe will fill the void. This void exists because they do not follow the Truth or pay allegiance to my beloved Son.
Not only do they idolise false gods, they pay allegiance to those poor souls who promote sin as if it is of no consequence.
Then, when they are presented with lies about my Son in the world today, they are quick to accept such untruths.

It is accepted to ridicule my Son yet, when other doctrines which do not contain the Truth, are criticised people cower in fear. They do not fear my Son.
They do not fear the one True God because they do not love Him. Their hearts are closed.

They continue following a path which brings them no comfort. Instead, this path leaves them dissatisfied and empty.

How I weep when I see their confusion. How I weep for my Son whom they hurt so much with their contempt. He who suffered so much for them and who died in the most agonising way. Yet they do not still understand the significance of His Death on the Cross.
It is only when a person accepts Jesus, the Christ, the True Messiah will they find peace.

Soon my Son will present to them the proof they demand. When they are shown the proof they will have to make the final choice.
They will either choose my Son and the Truth or they will accept the lies fed to them by the deceiver.

Pray children that hearts will be opened and that love of my Son will enable all of God's children to accept His Hand of Mercy. Your beloved Mother
Mother of Salvation

The false prophets are poised now and will pounce on this mission
Saturday, September 22nd, 2012 @ 15:30

My dearly beloved daughter I must warn you about false prophets who try to interfere with this mission.

So many poor deluded souls, who believe that they are receiving divine messages, are being led astray by the evil one.

He does this by preying on their love for me and targets, especially, holy devout souls.

Any person who tells you that they have a message from Heaven which instructs you to change or amend a message from Me is a liar.
This is not the way in which I authorise communications from Heaven. The only messages I allow to be communicated from one visionary to another is one of support and love, but only when this is necessary.
Messages received by genuine prophets or chosen souls are either true or false.

There is no in between. Heaven would never send a message to contradict another message received by a chosen soul from Heaven.
Beware of false prophets. Those who do not realise that they are false can cause terrible harm when they interfere with My Holy Word. You, My daughter, must not engage with those who say they come in My Name unless I instruct you otherwise.
The false prophets are poised now and will pounce on this mission. You must not engage with them.

Be alert to these dangers for the most dangerous of all will be the man who will come and claim to be Me.

Allow yourselves, My disciples, to be drawn to the false prophets and you will be easy prey to the antichrist and his false prophet.

Trust in My Holy Word. Many of you cannot, still, accept the Truth and you will argue with me but it will be of no use. For the biggest criticism you have of Me, is that I love all of God's children, especially sinners.
I love all equally. To those of you who accuse Me of favouring sinners know this.

Never try to confuse others by saying that Jesus condones sin. You know this is a lie. I detest the sin but love the sinner. Your Jesus

So many people are searching for the Truth and cannot find it
Sunday, September 23rd, 2012 @ 09:00

My dearly beloved daughter there comes a time when a man must ask himself - who am I and why do I live? The only answer, which brings him peace, is when he understands that he is a child of God.
Rather than deny the Truth, because of the pressures exerted by those who sneer at those who believe in God, he must be honest with himself.
He knows that the love he feels comes from God.

He knows, in his heart, that the wretchedness he feels when in darkness and despair comes from the other side. The dark side. So many people are searching for the Truth and cannot find it.
Although the Truth has been recorded in the Holy Book, many cannot accept that Holy Scripture contains all the answers they seek.
You must embrace the Truth and hold onto it for dear life for it is your path to salvation.

Many people will do everything that is possible to deny the Truth. Mainly they will use human intelligence to tear the Truth apart and have you believe a lie.
Every argument will be made to deny the Truth of God. So convincing will these arguments be that many believers will find it difficult to defend the Truth.
Your faith will stand the test of time but only if you allow Me to guide you day and night. For Me to guide you, you must never take your eyes off Me and lean on Me for support.
Speak with Me. Communicate with Me at any time of the day, in the car, at work, at school or in your church. It does not matter where for you can call on Me at any moment and I will respond.
This path, the route to Calvary is the lot of My followers. It is a very difficult hill to mount. You must endure the setbacks and the pain of rejection of those who will not accept your right to practice your religion. The top of the hill should be your goal. Only when you reach the top will you find peace.
Persevere, My beloved followers and My Love will be felt by you in such a way that it will give you a strength you would not believe possible.
I love you. I walk with you. I will never leave you. I bless you all. Your Jesus

Prepare to witness signs soon to be revealed from Heaven
Sunday, September 23rd, 2012 @ 20:00

My dearly beloved daughter it is with love that I ask all of God's children to prepare to witness signs soon to be revealed from Heaven.
Signs will be presented to the world in different ways in order to awaken God's children. Many will try to deny these signs and dismiss them as superstitious and in the imagination of believers.
For those who will witness the signs you must know that they will help you to prepare your souls. For when you have nurtured your souls and have asked for the forgiveness of your sins, your suffering, after The Warning, will be minimal.
Accept these signs, these miracles, as a Gift from Heaven.

Do not fight them or ignore them for they are proof of My Promise to prepare you all before My Second Coming. Go now and have faith.
Trust is the most important act of loyalty for Me, your Jesus. Trust in Me and all will be well.
Your Jesus

Any man who hates another, because of their religion, does not truly love God
Monday, September 24th, 2012 @ 15:55

My dearly beloved daughter any man who hates another, because of their religion does not truly love God. How it disgusts Me to witness the hypocrisy by those who claim to be devout followers of God.
These people threaten to kill those who disagree with them and murder those who insult their gods.

It is a sin to hate another. It is a mortal sin when you murder another or try to mortally wound another soul in the name of religion.

Don't you know that if you are quick to condemn another to death because they insult God that you are not following the Laws of God?
I call out to all religions and all creeds who say they believe in God. If you believe in God then you must show love to others even when they torment you or insult you.
Many paths lead to My Father but there is only one God. The True God is the Creator of the world and you can only be accepted into His Kingdom when you love your neighbour and this includes your enemies.
It is very easy to hate another for evil spirits infest and torment God's children every second. How the evil one rejoices when a religious man, who openly professes to love God, incites hatred and who does not think twice about murdering those he believes are his enemies.
No man will escape chastisement if he kills another. No man will be accepted into the New Paradise if he murders another in My Father's Name.
It may be difficult and it may hurt you when a man insults your faith but you must pray for him and you must never forget the Commandment "Thou shalt not kill."
My Father's Commandments are very simply. They are clear. They do not need to be defined but woe to the man who breaks My Father's Laws.
Your Jesus

There are only three ways to protect yourselves from the evil one
Tuesday, September 25th, 2012 @ 12:50

My dearly beloved daughter you must never become complacent and feel that this work, when it seems to be going well, will for one moment escape the scourge of the evil one. He is furious. He picks at every task you undertake, creates problems and obstacles, which leave you frustrated and helpless.
So many people are blind to the scourge he inflicts on humanity. Because they cannot see him they do not believe that he exists. Those who open the way to him, through sin, and allow him into their souls will find it impossible to rid themselves of the terrible hurt and discontent he will bring into their lives.
There are only three ways to protect yourselves from the evil one.

The first is, the Sacrament of Confession cleanses your soul, if you are genuine in your remorse. For non-Catholics please accept the Gift of the Plenary Indulgence inCrusade Prayer (24), given to the world through this Mission.
The second way is through the daily devotion to My Mother who has been given the power to crush Satan. Her Holy Rosary is an important shield, which will cover you and your family away from his evil eye.
The last is through the State of Grace, which you can achieve through regular communication with Me by receiving Me in the Holy Eucharist.
So many people who want to escape from the clutches of Satan, and who in their hearts know they have been sucked into a vortex of evil, must turn to Me and ask Me to help them through this special Crusade Prayer (78) Save me from Evil.
O Jesus protect me from the power of Satan.

Take me into Your Heart as I release all my allegiance to him and his wicked ways.

I surrender my will and come before You on my knees with a humble and contrite heart. I leave my life in Your Holy Arms.
Save me from evil. Release me and take me to Your safe haven of protection now and forever. Amen.
Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: Great changes will commence in the world very soon
Wednesday, September 26th, 2012 @ 16:40

My child great changes will commence in the world very soon.

It is time for the plan of Salvation to be introduced across all nations in the hearts of humanity.

So many people will be shaken with the Truth of where they come from and how they must redeem themselves in the Eyes of God.
So unprepared are God's children for these great events. It is because of the Love of God, for all His children that you are being warned.
Ignore these warning signs at your peril. Laugh or sneer at these Divine Interventions, which will take place to bring the hearts of man into the Heart of God and you will suffer.
Children you must stay alert at all times. The signs from Heaven and the miracle of Divine Intervention are drawing closer by the day.
Pray that you will be given the Graces to open your hearts to the Great Mercy of my beloved Son, Jesus Christ. All roads are opening to entice God's children back to the refuge of His Sacred Heart.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

Sin can be forgiven when you are alive. Not after death
Wednesday, September 26th, 2012 @ 22:12

My dearly beloved daughter I allow you this intense physical suffering to save more souls today. Offer this pain for those selected souls you must help Me salvage. This pain will not last long but when you are relieved know that many souls were saved from the fires of Hell and are now in Purgatory awaiting purification.
As a victim soul you must accept that I can allow you moments of suffering to help save the souls of God's children. You will, some day, meet these souls and then you will understand how much happiness this brings My Father. Know that when you suffer, I suffer with you in order to easy your pain. You are not alone. When you feel you cannot breath, this is the same feeling of suffocation felt by souls who, after death, face the fumes of the fires of Hell.
If only people knew the Truth of life after death. After the soul leaves the body, whether it is in a state of Grace or not, Satan torments through the power of seduction. He tries, even then, to draw souls to him. Prayer for such souls is very important.
I draw souls towards My Light. But only those who are in a State of Grace can withstand the Power of My Light of Mercy. If they are not pure of soul then they must be cleansed in Purgatory.
There are, My daughter, many layers in Purgatory and, depending on the sins committed by the soul, they will be filled with the cleansing Fire of the Holy Spirit.
Purgatory is painful for the soul and those who have to spend time there feel it like a physical pain as though they were still alive. Let no man underestimate the sacrifices needed to keep their souls in a state worthy of My Father's Kingdom.
My Father loves all His children but souls must earn the right to be fit to enter My Father's Kingdom. To be worthy they must redeem themselves in My Eyes while they are still alive. They must atone for their sins with a sincere heart.
Even at the point of death, a sinner can avail of My Great Mercy by asking Me to forgive him his sins. I will snatch him and take him into My Arms. I will then pour out My Mercy over him and then take him by the hand to the Gates of Paradise.
Sin can be forgiven when you are alive. Not after death. Your Jesus

Two billion souls, who will refuse My Hand of Mercy
Thursday, September 27th, 2012 @ 09:00

My dearly beloved daughter the Mission to salvage those two billion souls, who will refuse My Hand of Mercy, must form part of daily prayer for all those who call themselves a Crusader of God.
So many miracles will result in much of humanity being given the Gift of Salvation and entry into the New Paradise.

The ache in My Sacred Heart is painful because of these lost souls. This is why My disciples must pray hard so that they can all be united as one family in the New Era, for if My family is disjointed, it will bring Me terrible agony.
I call on you all to save those souls, who will stubbornly reject the acceptance of God, by reciting this Crusade Prayer (79) for 2 billion lost souls.
O Dear Jesus I beg You to pour Your Mercy over the lost souls.

Forgive them their rejection of You and use my prayer and suffering so You can, through Your Mercy, pour over them the Graces they need to sanctify their souls.
I ask You for the gift of clemency for their souls.

I ask You to open their hearts so they will go to You and ask You to fill them with the Holy Spirit so they can accept the Truth of Your Love and live with You and all of God's family forever.
Amen.

It is difficult for many people to accept God's Mercy. This is because of the power, which Satan holds over them; only they do not know this, in many cases.
In some cases, however, they are in no doubt about the Existence of God, yet they choose Satan in the full knowledge that God exists and that He created them. They turn their backs on God's Kingdom.
The kingdom they choose is the one promised to them by Satan. They believe that this kingdom, at the end of time, offers great wealth, great wonders and that it will be a world which glitters, except that it does not. All they will find will be a great lake of fire where they will suffer by the hand of the evil one. He will torment them for eternity and they will suffer every second of this pain for it can never end.
Now you know why I suffer such agony, for the very thought of the suffering which lies ahead for such souls, is too much to bear. Only your prayers, My followers, and My Mercy can offer them any hope.
Help Me to save them.

Your Jesus

This man will tell the world he is the Messiah and he will be applauded by many leading world figureheads
Friday, September 28th, 2012 @ 22:15

My dearly beloved daughter the great changes in the world, foretold in advance of My Second Coming, are about to unfold layer by layer.
The time for the imposters who will claim to come in My Name and to present themselves to the world is very close. So many people will be fooled into believing these false prophets for they will announce themselves with great pomp.
But one among them will deceive many for he will present himself as the king, in a humble way, to convince people that he is I, Jesus Christ.
This man will tell the world he is the Messiah and he will be applauded by many leading world figureheads. They will present him, first, as an extraordinary and compassionate political leader.
He will be seen as a talented peacemaker as I have told you. His airs and graces will display a mystical image, which will seem to be of divine origin.
His handsome good looks and his tantalising personality will appeal to the masses.

He is to be revealed to the world soon and his appearance will be sudden.

Those leaders, who will present him as a saviour, the man who will bring an end to war in the Middle East, are respected in many parts of the world. This is why this false messiah will be accepted so easily.
After some time his appeal will spread. The media will praise his diplomatic skills and his following will be large.

This is the man who will say he is the Messiah. He will tell everyone that he is Jesus Christ, who has come back to announce his second coming.
He is the antichrist.

Do not be fooled for one moment. I, Jesus Christ, came in the flesh the first time to save humanity. But know this. I will not come in the flesh this time. I will come, as a thief in the night. I will prepare the world, through these Messages, but I will not tell you the day or the hour for I do not know this. Only My Father knows of the time.

I will announce My Second Coming before the sign of My arrival, which will appear in the skies all over the world. Any man who claims to be Jesus Christ and who walks the earth as a man is a liar.
Run for he will bring untold misery and suffering. His deceit will lull souls into a false love of God. He will twist the Truth. Those who follow him are in great danger.
Your Jesus

Believers must never feel secure in the knowledge that they know the Truth
Saturday, September 29th, 2012 @ 19:15

My dearly beloved daughter, I must tell all those who believe in Me, Jesus Christ, to wake up and live their lives in Me now.

These Messages are not only being given to warn those who do not believe in Christ, the Redeemer of Mankind, they are also for believers in God.
Believers must never feel secure in the knowledge that they know the Truth.

To those of you who say you know the Truth of My Teachings you must never feel complacent. If you do then this can mean that you will neglect the work needed to sanctify your souls.
Believers can be confused about My Teachings. So many do not understand the meaning of My Second Coming.

Many of My followers think it means that all of humanity will be aware anyway and that, through My Mercy, they will be saved. O how I wish that this were true. How this would bring Me final relief. Sadly many will not be prepared. Many will refuse to listen to My warnings and instructions. As such they will fail to prepare adequately.
My Second Coming will happen. To those believers, who say they believe in the Truth contained in the Holy Bible, know this. It is easy for you to accept what was prophesised therein and which has already happened. It is not so easy to accept the future prophecies still to be witnessed by humanity
Accept also the fact that Divine Messages will be sent to prepare you. Accept that this preparation is taking place right now. Be vigilant at all times. Do not reject Me at this time, for this is the time of preparations.
Be thankful that you are being given this great gift. Your beloved Jesus

So many people today are obsessed with the pursuit of fame and self-glory
Saturday, September 29th, 2012 @ 23:00

My dearly beloved daughter, why is it so many people in the world believe that their mortality is indefinite?

So many people today are obsessed with the pursuit of fame and self-glory. So many of those who seek and achieve great recognition and success are idolised by those who believe that this is the glory which they must strive for and which will satisfy them.
Very little of their time is spent on what really matters. They trample on others to get what they want because of their insatiable desire to shine in glory before the world.
Their vanity is fed by the world of entertainment, the media, and their pursuit of self-perfection is applauded.

This is what ordinary people strive for today. They openly admire such ambition and this becomes like a religion. They idolise those who reach such heights and then set about imitating their lives.
Not once do they consider that such things are of no real consequence. They never stop to ask themselves: "Is this what my life is to consist of?"
They do not believe in God, in most instances, for if they did, they would know how displeasing it is, in the Eyes of God, to seek adulation in this way.
When a person constantly seeks attention, adulation and is obsessed with the image they portray to the world, they do not understand how short this road is. It will disappear in time and they will find themselves empty and with no love left to share with others.
They spend so much of their time loving themselves that they will have no room for any other love. They place their own needs before others. They will do anything, including committing acts, which offend God, to achieve self-glory.
This generation has been told so many lies about the way in which to live their lives. They are encouraged by a world, which believes that material gain, celebrity, culture and an ambition which will bring great admiration, are the most important things to strive for.
How little they know. How shocked they will be when they discover how wrong they were.

People who lead such lives will face disappointment when their lusts will not be satisfied. Every act to bring them more pleasure, through self-obsessed ambition, will fail to bring them peace.
Pray that soon people will realise that the pursuit of fame and self-glory only satisfies for a short time. There is only one goal, which you should strive for, and that is to follow the Teachings of the Lord.
When you do this you will be at peace.

You can still enjoy many of the pleasures in the world but you will understand what really matters.

So many young people place such value on how they appear to others. The pressures on them, to lead their lives by pursuing the same goals as those celebrities they admire is damaging their souls.
It is blocking out the reality of what is pleasing to God. It is blocking out the Truth.
Only the Truth will make them feel content and bring them peace, love, joy and happiness. I Am the Life they seek.
In Me they will find a life of Glory. This is the Glory they must seek.
For, they will live a life of Great Glory in the New Paradise if they turn to Me. This is the only glory, which will bring them untold joy.
Your Jesus

God's Love, once felt by man, is something no man can live without
Monday, October 1st, 2012 @ 16:30

My dearly beloved daughter, you must accept that when My followers believe in these Messages, it will bring them a torment of the soul from time to time.
Many will rejoice when they read My Holy Word and will accept it as a miracle.

Others will also accept My Messages, but on certain days they will be torn in two by the doubts, which will assail them. These doubts are natural.
For some they will question and question whether they are truly coming from Heaven. Then they will be full of anguish because they know that their lives are about to change and that the Second Coming will be witnessed by them.
This means that the lives they have led, up to now, will change beyond recognition.

This is frightening for many because they want to cling to their old complacent lives however unhappy they were.

Fear of the future, fear of the Hand of God and fear of Satan's army torment them. Yet, while My Messages can strike fear within their hearts, at times, they also bring comfort.
For one thing is certain. They will feel My Holy Spirit in their souls and once this happens they will become familiar with God's Love.
God's Love, once felt by man, is something no man can live without. It brings peace. So, no matter how fearful you, My followers, may be, you must remember that I, your Jesus, will never forsake you.
You are Mine.

I am the Life in your souls. Through Me, you will be saved. I am full of Mercy for souls who turn to Me for help. I will not let you suffer at the hand of Satan's followers. I will cover you with My Precious Blood. You have nothing to fear.
Instead, you are being given the graces to prepare yourselves. Now you must be brave, do not allow doubts to cloud your love for Me or blind you to the Truth of these Messages.
They are My Gift to you. They are being given to you so that you will be protected and kept safe from harm.

Always ask Me to allay your fears, for they are planted as seeds of discontent in your mind, by the evil one in order to distract you. I bless you. I give you peace. I give you My Protection. Trust in Me always.
Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: Many of my Son's Church leaders say nothing. They no longer defend, publicly, the Holy Name of my Son.
Tuesday, October 2nd, 2012 @ 15:30
