I am like a storm which is brewing. My Voice is like thunder in the distance.

As My Holy Word will now cover the earth, like a blanket, a rumbling sound will be heard in the distance.

As My Word spreads from man to man the storm will begin to get stronger and the rumbling of thunder will increase.

Soon the thunder will roar and few will fail to hear the Voice of God.

As the storm increases in strength many souls who try to baton down the hatches will be unable to prevent the storm of My Voice or the strength of My Mercy from touching their souls.
The time has begun for the intervention from Heaven to pour out over a pagan world full of darkness.

My Light will lift the hearts of even the most hardened of hearts as the Truth will begin to sink in. To all of God's children reading this message please remember My Promise to you now.
I am making myself known to you in these messages through My Holy Word.

My Spirit will invade your souls during The Warning.

Then I, your Jesus, will descend from the clouds at the Second Coming.

Then I will raise the New Jerusalem so that peace can, at last, be achieved in the New Era, the New World without end. My Power is almighty.
Satan may have certain powers but they are nothing. His power can be frightening but he cowers in fear before Me in terror. You must not give him more power by giving into this temptation. Nor should you allow fear of him to block your love for Me. When you fear Satan you are feeding his power and he can control your senses.
Only prayer, and much of it, can weaken his power and his grip over you.

Now that My Word is in print Satan will raise his army to prepare for a terrible battle.

All of you, My followers, must surrender your will and trust in Me completely as I lead you through this bloody battlefield. Make no mistake, Satan and his demons, are furious because of this plan, the final Plan of Salvation.
He will cause havoc with this work.

He will create debate, cast aspersions on this work and will do everything he can to stop My Book of Truth, My Holy Messages from being spread.
You may also expect disapproval from elements within My Church on earth and a raging argument among Christians as to the authenticity of My Holy Word.
When the storm ahead gathers speed, as My Word is multiplied in every tongue and in every language, the sound of My Voice will be deafening.
The Power of God must never be underestimated for I am the King of Mankind.

I now come, on behalf of My Eternal Father, to gather all of His children in the final battle when I will banish Satan into the lake of fire.
It will be a terrible battle and many souls will reject Me.

No matter how hard I will try, and despite My Power, it will be by their own free that they will choose the evil one.

Trust in Me and allow Me now to purify your souls so that you will be worthy of My New Paradise on earth. Link arms My followers in union to protect My Holy Word so that those who do not know Me can come to Me. I love you.
I bless all of you. Your beloved Saviour Jesus Christ

The Book of Life foretold contains the names of all those who will be saved
Monday, August 20th, 2012 @ 15:45

My dearly beloved daughter the Book of Life foretold contains the names of all those who will be saved. However, because of My Great Mercy, more souls will be saved because of The Warning.
Even more souls can also be saved because of your suffering and that of all chosen souls alive in the world today.

The prayers of My followers, including the recital of My Crusade Prayers to save souls, will be a powerful means of salvaging even the most hardened of souls.
Souls who will refuse My Mercy can now be saved because of the generous intercession of those amongst you who offer sacrifice, including prayer, fasting and the acceptance of suffering, in My Holy Name.
This is My promise such is My Great Mercy.

I bring many gifts at this time because of your love for Me. Accept them with love and thanksgiving.
I bless you. My Promise to bestow more Gifts, because of your response to this mission, My beloved disciples, will and can now be fulfilled because of your loyalty to Me.
Your Beloved Jesus

God the Father: Only when I am satisfied will I bequeath the most spectacular miracles for the world to witness.
Tuesday, August 21st, 2012 @ 18:00

My dearest daughter let no man underestimate the Force of My Anger as humanity succumbs further into the depths of sin.

I have sent you the prophets. Then I sent My Beloved Son, whom I sacrificed to save you and then I sent more messengers, all to little avail.
Few souls even looked at such messages from the prophets or accepted the signs given to the world by the Blessed Mother of My Beloved Son.
Because of My great love for you, as a Father, I am giving all of My children the Gift of Salvation yet again. You must not ignore My prophets for this could lose you your place in the inheritance, which I have planned for you.
Children many of you who believe in Me, your Eternal Father, fail to understand the secret of salvation.

This pathway to spiritual perfection lies in your ability to accept the purification needed to ensure that you are fit to stand before Me.
Many souls must be stripped bare of all worldly attractions, distractions and corruption of soul.

For those of you fortunate enough to have endured such a purification you will know that until you become, as a baby, little in My Eyes, you will be unable to surrender to My Holy Will.
Struggle against such purification and you will find it difficult to redeem yourself in My Eyes.

When you are free of all the world has to offer and focus on My Son, you will realise that the only real love and joy that exists comes from God. Nothing else, once you experience this, can satisfy you again.
You may slip from time to time but this is to be expected. For you cannot be freed from sin until the New World begins and you align your will to Mine.
My Plan of Salvation, which can only be achieved on earth by your allegiance to My Precious Son, has already commenced. It will not take long for the global conversion. This will be achieved through My end time prophet and as a result of The Great Warning.
Feel My Holy Spirit, children, invade your soul as it spreads very quickly across the earth. I pluck My children from their spiritual darkness in every part of the world.
I need your sacrifice and prayers to help in the salvation of souls.

Only when I am satisfied will I bequeath the most spectacular miracles for the world to witness.

When these miracles are presented they will multiply the conversion I need to take My children to safety and into the New Paradise.
Only then can we become a real family again.

I love you children.

I am pleased with those of you, generous of heart and pure of soul who recognise this Divine Call from Heaven. I bless you all.
God the Most High

Virgin Mary: When I waited with the apostles in the Cenacle for the descent of the Holy Spirit it took ten days of preparation.
Wednesday, August 22nd, 2012 @ 09:18

My child the wilderness in which My children find themselves in the world today is because they do not know how to be given the Gift of the Holy Spirit.
Just as I taught you, it takes a long time to be given the Gift.

It consists of a very tough journey before any of God's children can be made worthy to receive this special Gift.

When I waited with the apostles in the Cenacle for the descent of the Holy Spirit it took ten days of preparation.

Although these holy, devout and loyal servants of my beloved Son were promised the Gift they were not fully prepared spiritually to be given the Gift.
I, their beloved Mother, had to help them prepare their souls.

It meant teaching them the importance of full surrender of their free will. To become worthy they had to understand the depth of humility, to which they had to succumb, before they were ready.
Some of them thought that they had learned everything from my Son.

However, this was a sign of pride and when pride exists in you, you cannot receive the Holy Gift of the Holy Spirit.

To receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit you must become little before my Son, like a small child.

There can be no room for pride or arrogance. Yet, people today who claim to speak with authority about the way in which my Son speaks fall into a trap.
They, when claiming to be knowledgeable about spiritual matters, speak with an arrogance which does not reflect the graces which are given to those who genuinely possess this great Gift from Heaven.
Those who have been bestowed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit are submissive to the wishes of my Son. They are not boastful.
They are not aggressive.

They do not criticise another using the Name of my Son to do so.

They do not mock others, when proclaiming their interpretation of His Holy Word. They do not preach hatred.
When my Son's disciples were prepared by me, many arguments took place.

It took some time before they finally accepted what was expected of them.

Only then, when they understood how only humility of soul can allow the Holy Spirit to enter, were they finally prepared.

I urge all of God's children, especially those who believe in my Son, to ask me, their Mother, to allow me to prepare them for this great Gift.
My child, it took me a full year to prepare you and this was no easy feat. Do you remember how hard you found it to say my Holy Rosary? How hard you found it to surrender your will and to prove your humility?
Now that you have received the Gift it does not mean that you can take it for granted.

You must continue to pray, remain humble of heart and seek redemption every single day. For just as it is given, so too, can it be taken away.
I ask all those following these Messages to pray for the Gift of the Holy Spirit.

It is not enough to pray just the once and say that you have received the discernment you asked for and to then cast aspersions on these Divine Messages. If you do this then you have not been given the Gift.
Please call on me, your Blessed Mother, to help prepare you through this Crusade Prayer.

Crusade Prayer (74) for Gift of Discernment O Mother of God help me to prepare my soul for the Gift of the Holy Spirit.
Take me as a child, by the hand, and lead me on the road

Towards the Gift of discernment through the Power of the Holy Spirit.

Open my heart and teach me to surrender in body, mind and soul.
Rid me of the sin of pride and pray that I will be forgiven

for all past sins so that my soul is purified and that I am made whole so that I can receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit.
I thank you Mother of Salvation for your intercession and I await with love in my heart for this Gift for which I yearn with joy. Amen.
Remember children come to me, your Mother, to help you to open your soul to receive this wonderful Gift. When you receive this Gift I will take you before my Son.
For only then will you be truly ready for the next step on the stairway to spiritual perfection. Mother of Salvation.

Just as the soldier who pierced My Side was instantly converted so, too, will millions of souls
Wednesday, August 22nd, 2012 @ 20:10

My dearly beloved daughter you must not feel isolated from Me because of the enormity of this work.

For although it may seem to be of such magnitude, that you feel you will not be able to cope, know that I only ask of you that which you are capable of.
Rejoice that My Word is being sought out all over the world for this is My Heart's desire.

I desire that all of My disciples respond immediately to My Call for I need them to help Me in My Mission to save humanity. This is only the beginning of a rapid conversion when the Blood and Water will gush forth over every human soul.
My Blood and Water will convert even blackened souls. Just as the soldier who pierced My Side was instantly converted so, too, will millions of souls who, at this time, do not believe I exist.
Have not I told you that My Mercy is endless?

Have I not promised that miracles, sanctioned by My Father, will take place to bring the world together and all souls to their rightful inheritance?
So many souls are now responding to My Call. Their prayers alone will be multiplied and millions more will be saved. All souls are to be included in your efforts to salvage the whole of humanity.
Your goal, My dearly beloved disciples, must be not to allow any single soul to slip through the net. This net will be thrown out and cast into the waters to catch souls and save them. You My disciples are the fishermen. I give you the net through the graces I now bestow upon you.
You will help Me to save every living soul and not one single effort will be left undone - not one stone unturned - as I venture forth to save humanity once again.
So, instead of cowering in fear, worried about the huge response to My call, My daughter, you must rejoice. For at last My Holy Will is being fulfilled. Yet we still have a long way to go.
Your Jesus
