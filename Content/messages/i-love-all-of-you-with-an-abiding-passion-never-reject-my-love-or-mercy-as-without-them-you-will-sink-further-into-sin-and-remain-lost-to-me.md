Remember it is not because souls are worthy to enter My Kingdom that they receive reconciliation. It is because My Mercy is so great that I can save every single sinner if only they would seek the courage they need to ask Me for help.
When you recite this prayer, I will respond in such a way that you will find it very difficult to turn away from Me again. Your beloved Jesus

I bring hope. I bring Mercy. I bring salvation
Sunday, December 16th, 2012 @ 23:20

My dearly beloved daughter, it is important that My disciples do not cause fear in the hearts of their friends and families because of My Messages to you at this time.
I come to you all at this time to speak with you from Heaven in order to prepare you. I do this with love and joy in My Heart.

I come to help those who believe in Me so that they will be ready to accept Me in the state of grace needed to reign with Me in My Kingdom.
I come also to plead with those who cannot understand the meaning of God's Creation, especially those souls who use human reasoning to define everything in their lives. They believe only in what they can see or touch. These same souls will accept lies from those they believe are to be respected in their societies and nations. How easily they are fooled by the lies of man and how weak they are in that they reject the Truth of their Creation.
My task is to help you all. Not to threaten, but to draw you closer to Me so that you will receive comfort.

My Kingdom is your home. You must not feel any pressure to reject your family, so that you can unite your heart with Mine. Instead bring to Me your family through your prayers. Many will hurt you when you proclaim the Truth of My Word. But that is okay. Do not challenge them and try to force them against their will. I will take them into My Light of Protection when you recite My Grace of Immunity Crusade Prayer.
I Am full of love for you. Those who believe in Me will be greatly comforted by My Second Coming. Those other souls can be saved by your prayers. This is why I prepare you now. It is to save all of you so that you can enjoy the New Heavens and the New Earth.
I bring hope. I bring Mercy. I bring salvation. I bring to a conclusion the final covenant, the final age, which will be the fulfilment of My Father's Will.
Never fear Me for I Am your family, joined by My Flesh and Blood, by My Humanity, as well as by My Divinity.

Be at peace, My beloved followers. Rest on My Shoulder for My Love and Mercy is greater than any of you know. This is a time for rejoicing, not sorrow, for I have given you the Gift of Salvation. This Gift is for you as well as those who are lost. It is for everyone.
Your Beloved Jesus

The power of death over humanity will be defeated finally
Monday, December 17th, 2012 @ 12:15

My dearly beloved daughter, the day I come to reclaim My Inheritance, promised to Me by My Father, will be sudden.

While I prepare all of humanity for this great event, the day will come unexpectedly. The time for the beast to be cast into the abyss is near, and then the twelve nations will enjoy peace and unity.
During this time the saints in Heaven, and all those who died in My Favour, will be raised with the righteous who will survive the Tribulation. All will be resurrected and be given the Gift of perfect bodies, which will overcome the death known to humanity since the sin of Adam. They will enjoy peace and prosperity under My Spiritual Reign until My Kingdom is handed over to My Father.
This will be the first resurrection and will be followed by a one thousand year reign of perfect harmony according to the Divine Will of My Father.
During this time, sinners who denied Me will suffer. The Second Resurrection is not known to mankind, nor have the details been revealed to anyone other than the prophets Daniel and John the Evangelist.
These secrets will be revealed, in time, for they are not for your knowing now.

The Power of God will be manifested when the battle to salvage souls will succeed.The power of death over humanity will be defeated finally. This is My Promise. I will fulfil the prophecies laid down by My Father.
Those among you who are confused, have no fear. All is now in My Holy Hands, but be assured all that matters is the forgiveness of sin. This will be when all of you ask Me for the Gift of Redemption. It is that simple.
Your love for Me will yield the Gift of Life. Death, as you know it, will have no control or hold over you again. Your future is something to welcome with joy in your hearts for it is the greatest Gift of God and only those deserving souls will be bequeathed with such wealth. Be at peace. Trust Me. Love Me. That is all that matters.
Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: All those who promote abortion and who are responsible for it being introduced are guilty of mortal sin
Tuesday, December 18th, 2012 @ 18:45

My dear child, the most sacred Creation of My beloved Father, the life of those babies in the womb, is to be destroyed a millionfold all over the world.
The evil one has influenced governments in all parts of the world to ensure that abortion is not only accepted, but that it will be seen as a good thing.
How many tears are now being spilled in Heaven! All the angels and saints bow their heads in sorrow. God's children will be destroyed in many numbers as the time for the Great Tribulation commences.
Wars, famines, murders and suicides will increase. It is the sin of abortion, however, which incurs the Wrath of My Father more than almost any other sin.
Countries who condone abortion will suffer greatly by the Hand of God. Their countries will weep when their punishment is witnessed. All those responsible for the introduction of such a vile act will need much prayer.
My child, it is important that everyone recites My Holy Rosary every Friday until the last week in January 2013 to stop the spread of abortion.
Every child murdered in the womb becomes an angel in My Father's Kingdom. They pray, every day, for each mother who intervened knowingly and without hesitation to end the life of the child within her. Their prayers are being used to salvage the souls of their Mothers.
All those who promote abortion and who are responsible for it being introduced are guilty of mortal sin. Pray, pray, pray for these sinners as they are in great need of the Mercy of God.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

My Flames of Mercy, like Tongues of Fire, will descend on every soul soon
Tuesday, December 18th, 2012 @ 19:30

My dearly beloved daughter, it is time for each of My followers to understand that My Mercy must be accepted without fear.

I am not coming to harm or judge God's children during The Warning. I come only to prepare them by revealing to them the truth in their hearts.
Only by trusting in My Love and Divinity can you feel real joy and peace. If you allow fear to grip your heart, you will not be able to accept My Gift. Rejoice, for I love all of you.
The time to celebrate My Birth is important, as fewer and fewer nations tolerate My Name. When you celebrate My Birth, you acknowledge your own salvation.
I have given you the Gift of Freedom. Now share The Truth with others without fear in your hearts.

When the time comes for the whole world to witness the public event of My Second Coming, you will regret not having spread My Word to lost souls.
Please prepare your hearts and souls so that they can be cleansed in anticipation of My Promise to come again.

Use this time in prayer. Spend time with family and those close to you. Help those who are troubled in body and spirit.

My Flames of Mercy, like Tongues of Fire, will descend on every soul soon. You must not stop in fear or be worried. All I ask is that you are prepared at all times.
Your Jesus

Satan will be bound during My Reign and will no longer deceive God's children
Wednesday, December 19th, 2012 @ 12:30

My dearly beloved daughter, the world must know that the Era of Peace will be the culmination of My Promise, where I will Reign over the New Heavens and the New Earth. This will be a Spiritual Reign and My Church, the New Jerusalem, will be at peace and My Word will be heard amongst all nations.
Satan will be bound during My Reign and will no longer deceive God's children. This Reign, will not be a symbolic one, but where the Tree of Life will breathe Love and Peace so that all those who are blessed to enjoy My New Paradise will not suffer death even when Satan will be released, albeit for a short time, at the end of this period.
My Plan is according to the Will of My Father and no man has the right to deny the Will of God.

Make no mistake, you must accept the Word of God which is contained in My Father's Book because if you do not then you will be deceived as to the prophecies given to man since time began.
Follow only My Path. Accept My Promises. Do not doubt Me for you will insult Me. You either, accept Me as your Saviour and trust in Me completely, or not at all.
My Word is the Truth. The Truth will, when accepted by every living soul, be the key to freedom and to the Gates of My New Paradise.
Your Jesus

I died for you. Because of this you must trust Me now
Wednesday, December 19th, 2012 @ 21:00

My dearly beloved daughter, I must warn you that criticism will mount against you and My Word, given to you at this time.

You must not allow distractions or doubts to stop you from imparting every single Word I give you. Man must never doubt the prophecies handed down since the day of Moses. Not one prophecy contains untruths.
Now as I reveal to the world the secrets and My plans for humanity, kept from you, up to now, do not turn away. For I present to you now many things still to come, which you, My disciples, must be informed of, so that you do not fail to prepare for My Glorious Return.
Let no one deny themselves the gift I bring of eternal life. Those amongst you, fortunate to enter the New Era when Heaven and Earth will become one, must follow the Path of Truth.
Now is the time for your faith in Me, your Saviour, to be truly challenged and tested. You will soon be bullied into rejecting My Messages. Every effort will be made to force you to reject My Word and to declare the Truth to be heresy.
Turn your minds now to My Birth. To the Teachings I gave humanity so that they could learn how to prepare their souls. To the Sacrifice made by My Death on the Cross to salvage souls.
I died for you. Because of this you must trust Me now.

I Am the Light, which shines down upon the path you must walk. On either side of this path, evil spirits will pull at you, torment you, try to get you to walk back the same way you came and into the darkness. They will do this through the taunts of others who will pull you apart because of your loyalty to these Messages.
You must stay in silent meditation, read My Word and feel My Presence. Allow My Holy Spirit to calm your heart and feel My Love envelop you. As your pain intensifies, because of this Mission, know that you are in full union with Me, your Jesus.
Never give up. Do not reject My Hand of Mercy. Allow Me to embrace you in order to give you the courage needed to continue on this journey with Me until the day I come to reward you.
Your beloved Jesus

God the Father: The time for great change, for the good of all, is upon you
Thursday, December 20th, 2012 @ 19:15

My dearest daughter, I call on all My children to uphold the Name of My only Son, Jesus Christ, and show Him the honour, which has been accorded to Him amongst humanity.
My Angels in My Holy Kingdom, ring out and rejoice because of the Mercy, which is to be granted to all, through My Son.

This great Divine Gift will be used to vanquish the darkness, which covers the world. It will be by My Divine Intervention that I will be able to save most of My children.
This Christmas, a time of great rejoicing as you celebrate the birth of the Saviour I gave the world, is a turning point in the history of the human race.
As your Father, I bless you all and bestow, with a deep compassion, this great Gift of Mercy. I gather you, all of My Creation, so that I can cleanse you of every doubt, every sin and every blasphemy against the Laws of My Kingdom.
This great cleansing of the earth will take some time, but I will hasten these times of persecution.

Your suffering, by the hands of corrupt governments, who do not accept My Laws, will be difficult but will not last too long.

I will give all of My enemies time to open their eyes to the Truth of the glorious Paradise I have awaiting to unveil to the world.

Rejoice. Praise My Son, for it is because of Him, that I present the New Paradise where the Reign, promised to Him by Me, will evolve.
The time for great change, for the good of all, is upon you.

My Power will be shown in all its strength and glory for the world to witness.

I Am the Beginning. I Am the End. My New Kingdom, the New Paradise, will finally replace the old. The earth was tarnished by the sin of Adam and Eve.
The perfect creation of man was destroyed when sin brought to an end the Gift of immortality. Soon I will reverse all that was sullied by the contamination caused by Satan and his demons. They will no longer be masters of temptation.
I will now send My Son to reclaim the Throne, which was created for Him.

The battle for this Throne is fierce, but My Power prevails and every miracle will be used to bring My Family back safely into the Divine Sacred Heart of My Son.
You are, My children, lost and in pain. Now I send My Son to begin the process to take you to your rightful home. I love you, dearest children of Mine. I have never forsaken you, although you could be forgiven for believing this. You are now being called. No man will be excluded from this announcement from Heaven.
Pray, children, that all will respond to My Son's Mercy.

Your beloved Father God the Most High

My Love for humanity is felt by many. Sadly, those who do not look for it will not find it
Friday, December 21st, 2012 @ 22:20

My dearly beloved daughter, to love Me is simple. You do not have to be learned in Holy Scripture. All you need to do is this.

Call to Me, even when in doubt about My Existence. I will fill you with My Presence unexpectedly. You will feel a Love like never before. And then you will know The Truth.
I Am real. I Am there and I love each of you. True love pierces your heart with a powerful emotion of attachment. It is a two-way gift. You will love Me and you will wonder how can this be?
My Love for humanity is felt by many. Sadly, those who do not look for it will not find it. To those who still find themselves wandering away from Me, all you need to do is call upon Me, so that I can enlighten your soul.
My birth heralded the proof of My Father's Love for the human race. He sent Me, your Saviour, because of His Love for you.

Love is not something you should ever take for granted, as it is the greatest Gift from God. It transcends every other feeling and can defeat evil if you would only embrace it.
My Spirit of Love, My Protection covers you at this special time. You are Mine. I Am in your heart. All you need do is to allow My Love to fill you because when you do you will feel true peace.
I bless all of you.

Your Jesus

My Word will be like a sword, which will cut through confusion and lies.
Friday, December 21st, 2012 @ 22:50

My dearly beloved daughter, the time for My Teachings and My Holy Messages to be spread into every corner of the world, is now.
I will ensure that the Book of Truth, promised to the world, will be ready in every nation and every language. My disciples and My Sacred Servants will preach from the four corners of the earth.
Billions will follow My Word and many will, finally, read the Holy Gospel.

My Father's Book, the Holy Bible, will be revisited and My Word will be read again.

Now, My Messages today, contained in the Book of Truth will be food, which will be fed to God's children when it will be deemed illegal to read the Holy Word of God in the future.
You, My disciples, must convert those who do not know Me. If they do not know Who I Am, they cannot prepare themselves properly for My New Kingdom.
My Word will be like a sword, which will cut through confusion and lies. It will touch the minds, hearts and the souls of all. Some will take time to digest My Word, but most of the world's population will accept the Truth, once they are given it.
Please pray for the courage, the strength and the will to do what it is that I ask of you. Remind them that I died for them. Tell them that the time for Me to come again is soon. Comfort them by revealing to them the great Gift of the New Paradise I Am to reveal.
Tell them that I Am coming to save them and to end their suffering. Your Jesus

I shower you with this Special Blessing today
Saturday, December 22nd, 2012 @ 20:36

My dearly beloved daughter, Christmas Day is My Gift to humanity. It is because of this day that eternal life became possible for mortal man.
I, Jesus Christ, Saviour of the World, welcome you all, God's children, into the Kingdom promised to Me by My Father.

I came into the world unknown by but a few. My Birth changed the future. My Promise was accepted by My followers. They knew that I would come again but had no idea when. They listened to My Teachings, although many of them were not learned men.
They were poor and lived simple lives. Yet, they were the ones who welcomed Me.

The same will be true now when I prepare you for My Second Coming. It will be those souls with a simple love for Me who will open their hearts to My Call. And it will be those amongst you, humble of heart and pure of soul, who become My disciples of today. It will be through you, just as it was when I walked the earth, that My Word will be heard and believed.
I shower you with this Special Blessing today. I desire that you accept My Blessing of Protection through this, Crusade Prayer to welcome Me, the Messiah, as I will unveil My New Kingdom.
Crusade Prayer (90) Thanksgiving for Your Most Glorious Second Coming

O My Jesus, I offer You praise and thanksgiving for Your Most Glorious Second Coming. You, my Saviour, were born to give me Eternal Life and to free me from sin.
I offer You my love, my thanks and my adoration as I prepare my soul for Your Great Coming. Amen.

Go now and prepare. For the times are short and much is needed to be done in order to salvage every soul. I bring you Peace, Love and Joy on this special day.
Your Jesus

The family unit, and the destruction of it, will be at the root of everything
Sunday, December 23rd, 2012 @ 15:30

My dearly beloved daughter, many of those sacred servants of Mine, are to face a terrible challenge. This will be one, which will convince them to take one of two separate paths. It will be up to each, by his own free will, as to which path he must choose. For the abomination will make itself known shortly.
Many of My sacred servants will not be immediately aware of what is happening. It will only be when they read letters, given to them from those in high places, that they will find difficulty.
Those who uphold My Holy Word, given to man through the Gift of the Holy Bible, will be challenged and urged to accept amendments. These amendments will be given to them and they will be expected to swallow them, and accept them as The Truth. They amount to one thing.
They will urge those holy sacred servants of Mine, to accept tolerance of sin.

They will be told that God is an ever-merciful God and that He loves everyone. Yes this part is true. But then, they will be instructed to condone laws, which are an abomination in My Eyes. The family unit, and the destruction of it, will be at the root of everything.
Others will be asked to accept a new type of ceremony, which will replace the Mass and the Presence of My Holy Eucharist.
It will be deemed as an all-inclusive move to join all Christians and other religions as one.This will be the beginning of the end.

The day the daily Sacrifices of the Mass are cut will be the beginning of all events to unfold, as foretold to John the Evangelist. It will be the time of the rise of the beast and his influence will be great. He will win over the hearts and souls of many priests. His aim is to stop all Masses and to desecrate the Holy Eucharist.
He already does this, through black masses, held in many Catholic Churches. The core of disloyal servants is plotting against My Church and they will mislead many.
Be alert. Open your eyes and beg Me for the strength you are going to need, in order to stand up against this vile and wicked plan. This battle within My Church on earth will be vicious. Priest against priest. Bishop against Bishop. Cardinal against Cardinal.
Let it be known that those amongst you, My sacred servants, who know Me and love Me, I will lead you. I will guide you. I will give you the strength to deal with these enemies of God. You are not alone.
You must never listen to lies, given or presented to you, in My Holy Name. Only you know the Truth in your hearts. Listen to your heart. Remain loyal to all that you have been told is the Law of God.
If you are presented with anything, which seems to be in contradiction of My Teachings, then you must turn your back. Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: The day I brought the world a Saviour, it changed the destiny of humanity
Monday, December 24th, 2012 @ 18:00

My child, the day I brought the world a Saviour, it changed the destiny of humanity.

This little child I loved with a passion like any other mother. But there was an extra grace given to me by My Father. That was the grace of protection. I protected my Son, from the start, in a way which was different. I knew that He was the promised Messiah and, therefore, I had been given a very special responsibility, although I had no idea of the magnitude which this responsibility would entail.
I was not given to understand, early on, that my Son, the Saviour, sent by God to save the human race from the fires of Hell, would be killed. This part of my mission came as a terrible shock and my pain cannot be described, so intense was it.
I suffered through my Son, in Him and with Him. Even today, I feel His pain and sorrow at the disbelief of my Son's Existence in the world today. As the Mother of Salvation, my responsibility is to assist my Son in His plan to salvage souls.
This is the time of the deluge; this time for swift and sudden change. As wars will break out, and a great war emerges from the ashes, God's Plan will increase in its pace to awaken His Presence amongst all nations and all races.
My child, I plead with you to pray the most Holy Rosary as I weep today. My tears, which you have just witnessed are for those souls who will not acknowledge my Son. It is those Christians who say that they accept Jesus Christ, as Saviour, and who insult Him, by not praying to Him, who sadden Him the most.
The spread of atheism is like a dreadful epidemic sweeping the earth. God has not been forgotten, instead, His Existence is being deliberately ignored. His laws banned from your countries. His Churches not honoured. His sacred servants too timid and not courageous enough to proclaim His Holy Word.
The earth will now change both physically and in spirit. The cleansing has begun. The battle will be waged between those who follow the evil one and God's Remnant Church.
Those loyal to my Son must always call on me, your beloved Mother of Salvation, so that I can consecrate you to my beloved Son, in order to grant you much needed graces. You must be prepared as a soldier of Jesus Christ. Your armour must be made stronger, because your role is as a crusader and you will have to march against great cruelty and injustice.
Go in peace children and keep in daily prayer as the changes commence, so that the salvation of humanity can be achieved.

All will be done according to the Holy Will of my Father, through His only Son, Jesus Christ. You, my children, who ask for my help, will be granted great protection for your nations.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

There will be a great deluge. You will also witness smaller floods across other countries
Tuesday, December 25th, 2012 @ 19:20

My dearly beloved daughter, My Plan of Salvation for the world, began in My Time, on the 22 December 2012. This time in the world is Mine, as I gather all God's children together as one, as the great battle begins.
This period of Great Tribulation will last some time. The wars will escalate until the big war is declared and the world will change.
All nations will witness the changes. You must be prepared for this and be accepting, for all these things must happen before My Second Coming.
There will be a great deluge. You will also witness smaller floods across other countries.

The climates will all begin to change and your weather will be different, in a way, which may seem strange to you.

This is a time for all those who have opened their eyes to the Truth, to plan the path for Me, so that I can welcome all in My Sacred Arms.
Have no fear, for My Love will dilute much and your prayers can, and will, mitigate many of these things, as well as, the atrocities planned by the beast.
Your Jesus

God the Father: Soon, a new Light, a new sun, will be seen
Thursday, December 27th, 2012 @ 18:20

My dearest daughter, this is a Message of great hope for all My children.

The time for the changes, as foretold, when the earth will turn; the planets will change and the climates will no longer be predictable, is upon you.
My Great Power is now being manifested in Heaven, as it is on earth, as I lead the battle against My enemies. Satan and his demons are being defeated, but they put up a terrible defence. With them, they suck My poor children, whose hearts are filled with political and worldly ambitions, into playing a role, as they try to crucify My children.
Man is weak. Man is easily seduced. Because of his blindness to the Truth, laid down by Me, from the beginning of Creation, man believes in lies. He believes the lies, spewed out by the evil one, because he is attracted by the promises of power and pleasure.
My children must acknowledge the glorious and splendid Light of My Kingdom. You, My daughter, have seen this Light and you know how powerful it is. You know the Power of God, and how it envelops you. Can you imagine what this will be like when My New Paradise is revealed? You, My daughter, have glimpsed but just a small portion of this glorious and gleaming Light.
It is important to welcome the Light of My Son into your hearts. When you invite Him to salvage you, and take you into His Sacred Heart, you will feel this Light.
The Light of the New Dawn - the New Era - will slowly, but surely, illuminate the world. Soon, a new Light, a new sun, will be seen. It will be larger and will be the cause of much wonder.
This is a sign of My Power and My Majesty. It will be a miracle and will prove that man does not fully understand the secret of Creation.
Only I, God the Creator of the Universe, command all that is. All that will be. All that can be. No man, no scientist, can solve these most sacred secrets, as it is not for man to understand at this time.
The wonders of My Creation, and the force of My Power, will be shown to the world. Let no man make the error of believing that Satan, and his wicked followers, have any power to bring you the wonders which I have Created for every single creature. I have promised to reveal the Truth so that you, My children, can wipe away the cobwebs which cover your eyes.
When the Day comes for the Truth to be finally accepted by you, I will grant you the most splendid riches, graces and a life you could never envisage, for it is beyond your imagination.
I am happy to impart this Message of hope today. I hope it brings you much happiness and peace. My Promise, to bring you to your final inheritance, is to become a reality, soon.
Your Loving Father God the Most High

Knowledge can very often blind you to the Truth
Friday, December 28th, 2012 @ 06:05

My dearly beloved daughter, it is only when your heart is truly open to Me that you can experience My Light and acknowledge the Truth.
Many say that they have asked for the Gift of discernment and that they prayed to the Holy Spirit in order to receive it. Not all who ask, are given the insight they need, however, to receive this precious Gift. Yet, they will say that they have. Then they insult Me by claiming that My Holy Word makes them uncomfortable. They claim that their concerns must mean that My Holy Messages are coming from the spirit of evil.
To those of you who proudly proclaim your twisted interpretation of My Holy Word, given to you through these Messages, to be false, I have this to say.
When did you last come before Me naked? Without the screen of pride shielding you? When did you come before Me, on your knees, calling Me to truly guide you, without you first putting your hands over your ears by refusing to listen? Don't you know that I will only enlighten you with the Gift of discernment when you come before Me without any pre-conceived views of your own? You cannot be freed from the chains of intellectual pride, which blinds you to the truth of spiritual knowledge, until you are stripped of all human pride.
To those amongst you who spend years studying Holy Scripture, and who consider yourselves to be well versed - and therefore more worthy to define My word - you must think again.
Knowledge of My Father's Book does not qualify you any more than the beggar in the street, with no education of spiritual matters. Knowledge can very often blind you to the Truth. Knowledge based on your own human interpretation of My Father's Book means nothing when it comes to understanding the Word of God.
Those of you who boast of your learned ways by following the Holy Scriptures of God, and then use this to deny My Word given to the world today, are guilty of sin. Your sin is the sin of pride. You offend Me because your pride is worth more to you than love for Me, in its most simple form.
Love for Me, your Jesus, comes from the heart. Souls worthy of My Kingdom recognise My Voice quickly. Souls who defy My Word and encourage others to outwardly reject Me are influenced by the spirit of evil. You disgust Me. Your vile voices, where you shout out and proudly declare your worthiness, based on your knowledge of Holy Scripture, will be silenced.
My patience is never ending, but for those of you who stand before Me and damage My Plan of Salvation, with deliberate intent, you will be cast into the wilderness in the blink of an eye.
Your Jesus

Never fear Me for I come in peace
Saturday, December 29th, 2012 @ 19:36

My dearly beloved daughter, again, I say to all of you, dear disciples of Mine, not to be fearful. While events to come may be distressing for you to witness, remember these, My Holy Words, given to you now.
My Love for humanity is so great that I forgive easily, any sin, no matter how offensive, once true remorse is shown by the sinner. Never fear Me if you truly love Me because I protect you at all times. Yes, you will suffer in My Name, when you walk behind Me. But this is something, which you must accept. It is such a small price to pay for the Glory, which lies ahead of you.
Those who, however, walk in front of Me in the mistaken belief that they do not need the Presence of God in their lives need to be fearful. These sinners, who will never show remorse, for they believe that they are in control of their own destiny, will fall into the abyss. This, the trap laid down for them by the evil one, can be likened to a ticking clock. For every minute they continue to forsake Me, their time is shortened. Their time to redeem themselves in My Eyes is short.
Know that the two armies for the battle of souls have now lined up in order to prepare for the war. Time is moving on so please be prepared at all times.
Never fear Me, for I come in peace. Be fearful, however, of the beast who will be seen to come in peace, but who comes to destroy you. He, the evil one, and his followers on earth are those you should be fearful of. Not Me.
Your Jesus

He will, by the power of the occult, perform what will be seen to be cures for people who are terminally ill
Sunday, December 30th, 2012 @ 17:50

My dearly beloved daughter, I wish to tell you that the changes, which will prepare the world for My Second Coming, are about to be seen by the whole world.
The wars in the Middle East will accelerate and be widespread. They will involve the West as well as the East. The turmoil will be halted by the man of peace, the beast, the antichrist. Many will, in time, believe that he is God, the Messiah; so much power will he seem to possess. His powers have been accorded to him by the father of evil, Satan.
He will, by the power of the occult, perform what will be seen to be cures for people who are terminally ill. They will be cured of their illnesses temporarily and people will believe that his powers will have come from Heaven. That he is I, Jesus Christ. They will believe that he comes to prepare the world for the New Era and that the Second Coming is taking place before them.
He will perform other miracles, but they will simply be an illusion. Some sacred servants of Mine will drop before him and adore him. Political leaders will publicly applaud him. He will be seen as the good and humble messiah and he will emulate all My traits. Sadly he will deceive many.
I beg you, My disciples, to warn people that I, Jesus Christ, will not come in the flesh. This cannot be. I have already come to earth in the flesh and this cannot happen a second time. When I come again it will be through the way in which I left and then the wicked will be banished and My New Paradise will replace the earth.
Do not be deceived. Be alert. I will continue to warn you about the antichrist and the lies he will present to the world. In this way, you can help Me save those poor souls who will follow him slavishly into the pits of hell.
Your Jesus

You will be the focus of much hatred
Monday, December 31st, 2012 @ 19:25

My dearly beloved daughter, the burden upon you, the messenger, sent to prepare the way for My Second Coming, is to become heavier.
You will be the focus of much hatred, and many, including priests from within My Church, will try to destroy you.

The same will be true of those who spread My Messages. As the carriers of the Truth, they too, will be verbally attacked.

This is the time when you must keep to yourself and simply continue to do what is needed to ensure that as many as possible are given access to these Messages.
As My Holy Word begins to reach many corners, the anger against them will deepen. When the Messages are pulled apart and, in some cases, declared heresy, you must keep moving. Remain together and do not listen to the poisonous rants, which will be hurled at you.
Remain strong and courageous. Keep by My side as we walk this path to Calvary. For make no mistake this difficult Mission has been foretold and it will be very difficult for many of you.
I bless you all as I warn you that you must not fret when the attacks become fiercer. It is because this is My Holy Word that much hatred will be shown. This is the price to be paid for the salvation of souls, including those who torment you the most.
Your Jesus

The Temple of God will be desecrated beyond recognition
Tuesday, January 1st, 2013 @ 19:20

My dearly beloved daughter, the new dawn has arisen and the changes have commenced in preparation for My Second Coming.

Wars in the Middle East will now escalate and many will die by the hands of the evil group. They, the evil group, are going to be stopped, however, by the Hand of My Father. Each one struck down, as they pose a greater danger to God's children.
My Plans are being manifested and those among you, chosen by Me to lead the remnant Church will swiftly build bases throughout the world. These places will be where you will go to honour Me, in peace, when your churches will not welcome you in the way it is meant to be.
Your churches will become no more than places of entertainment where pagan rituals and music will be staged in elaborate ceremonies. Supposedly, these events will be to honour God. Instead, they will idolise sinful acts and they will declare them to be in accordance with My Teachings.
Many will present themselves, soon, as the new servants of God. Many will never have been prepared in the Christian Church and, therefore, will not be fit to present the Holy Sacraments to God's children. They will be imposters. They will dictate to all, the truth of what, they say, are the teachings of God in today's world. Their lies will reach the ears of humanity all over the world.
Many will be attracted to what they will perceive to be a fresh, new approach, to My Teachings and the Love of God. All will be a terrible lie. Many will be deceived into accepting the new One World Religion.
As the false church grows and attracts many celebrities, the media and political leaders, My Remnant Church will grow. Many of My sacred servants will be disloyal to Me and join in the new One-World Religion where they will be welcomed with open arms.
These imposters will cause terrible hardship for Christians everywhere, if they do not accept this new, politically endorsed cultural organisation, which will call itself a church of God.
While Christians will be the main target of hatred, the House of Israel will also be sought out and the Jews will be made scapegoats in this war for souls.
Nothing you see will appear to be different on the exterior in the early days. Soon, there will be seen, a rich and powerful building in Rome which will become a meeting place. All religions will be made welcome here until they are forced to swallow the lies presented to them by the New World Order.
It will, in time, become unacceptable for certain Christian practices to be held in public.

These will include the Sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion. They will be deemed to be unacceptable in a modern and secular world and you will find it impossible to receive them. The Sacrament of Marriage will be changed and marriage will be available in a different form. The only way to receive the True Sacraments at that stage will be through the Remnant Church.
To My sacred servants who will suffer in My Name, as they will struggle to hold onto the Sacraments and the Holy Mass, know this. Your duty is to Me, through your Holy Vows, and you must never be tempted to deviate from the Truth. Pressure will be put on you to desert the ways of the Lord. Your voice will become just like a whisper as the enemy tries to drown out the True Word of God.
Gather together. Unite. For very soon the Temple of God will be desecrated beyond recognition. All you need do is follow Me, listen to your heart and your conscience. Be ready at all times, for this difficult journey ahead. You will need all your courage, your strength and your perseverance.
Know that, at the end of your journey, I will be waiting to sweep you into My Holy Arms and into the safe haven of My New Paradise.
Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: Not all will accept freedom. Many will side with the evil one and reject my Son
Wednesday, January 2nd, 2013 @ 16:29

My child, much will now unfold in the world and many events are necessary, in order to purify God's children.

It is important that the hearts of all are opened to the Truth, the Holy Word of God. If they do not open their hearts, they will not be able to accept the Truth of my Son's promise to humanity.
He will come again, and soon, to redeem His Kingdom on Earth. It will be prised away from the evil grip of Satan. All of God's children will be offered the freedom they need to become one with my Son.
Not all will accept freedom. Many will side with the evil one and reject my Son. They will be so weak that they will not accept His Promise and will continue to pursue worldly ambitions.
I ask you children to be generous towards these souls. They will, not only reject my Son's Mercy, they will harass and sneer at all those brave souls, who will stand up and proclaim the Truth of God.
Keep in daily prayer, children, and then hand over any fears you may have to my Son. He loves you and wishes to unburden you of such sorrow and pain. Come to me, your beloved Mother, and I will ask Him to make you stronger in your allegiance to Him.
Your Beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

Love all those who persecute you, in My Name. Then pray for them
Wednesday, January 2nd, 2013 @ 20:00

My dearly beloved daughter, you must inform all of My followers that their prayers will help to mitigate much of what has been foretold.
Prayer is so powerful, that if enough of the prayers I give to the world, through the Crusade Prayers, are said, that much of the difficult tribulation can be curtailed.
I also must point to the power of forgiveness. When you are persecuted, in My Name, you must pray for those souls who torment you. When you pray for them, from the heart, I will cover them with your love. When you pray for your enemies, you delay Satan's mission to take souls away from Me.
My daughter, I must now instruct you, and My followers, to remain calm in the face of much opposition to these Messages. You must never fear the Word of God, even when it brings you much pain from the outside world.
Do not think that My Kingdom is easy to enter. For each of you who truly loves Me, there will be one or two more people tempted to stop you in your allegiance to Me. This has been the case since My Death on the Cross. It will remain this way until My Second Coming.
My disciples will attract those souls who seek Me out. My disciples will then embrace these souls, so that My followers will swell to become one, in union with Me. It will never be without suffering, this lonely pathway to My Kingdom.
When they throw accusations at you, think of My own journey to Calvary. Think of My silence, and the dignity of simply focusing on My sole objective, to save souls, for every second you endure ridicule, in My Name.
This will make your journey more bearable. Let your detractors scream abuse; let them call you a fool; let them declare My Messages to be heresy. For when you do this, their wicked tongues will have no power over you.
Love all those who persecute you, in My Name. Then pray for them. And when you forgive them, you will destroy the power which Satan holds over them.
This is the secret of humility.

Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: The reason why so many people are in such pain and darkness is because they do not believe in God
Thursday, January 3rd, 2013 @ 21:00

My child, the reason why so many people are in such pain and darkness is because they do not believe in God.

The faith, which was meant to be instilled in every soul, by those appointed ones, has lapsed. So many have turned away from God and find, now, that their lives are empty and without meaning. When a soul turns their back on God, they become restless. They fill the vacuum with a love of false things, which will never satisfy their desire for peace.
True peace can only be found through the Sacred Heart of my Son. When you accept Jesus Christ, as your Saviour, you will never die. Nor will you remain dry of spirit. My Son brings you salvation, and even the weakest amongst you will find an inner strength, when you call on Him.
Those who have never been taught the Truth, because it was denied to them, will be offered the Hand of Mercy by my Son. He will enlighten them because they are the ones He wishes to draw into His Glorious Kingdom.
The Glory of God will, if you allow the Truth to be given to you with an open heart, save you. When you recognise God's Goodness, you could never again put anyone, or anything, before Him.
Please pray that the Light of Truth will open the mind, heart, body and soul of each one of you during The Warning. It is why God is sending such a Gift of Mercy. Please respond to His Call.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

I call out to all those who are unsure as to whether I Exist, or not
Thursday, January 3rd, 2013 @ 21:10

My dearly beloved daughter, I call out to all those who are unsure as to whether I Exist, or not.

I realise how difficult it is for you to believe in a life, other than the one you live now. I know that you find it hard to accept in My Divine Presence. Yet, know that when you love someone, that the Presence of God, in your soul, allows for this Gift. Use this love to call on Me and I will speak to your heart.
This is an age where, very soon, you will know, instinctively, that many events in the world are being caused by the evil present in the hearts of men with cruelty in their souls.
This is the time when I will make My Voice heard amongst you. I speak through My prophets in order to enlighten you so that I can show you the Love that I have for you. Do not pull away from Me. There is a spark of recognition for Me within your soul. Now is the time for you to ponder on your future, for you must know this. Without Me; without My Love and My Mercy, you will never find peace.
I Am the Truth. I bring news, which may not sit comfortably with you, but I speak the Truth. The Truth is difficult, in the beginning, to accept because it reveals the bad as well as the good. People only want to see the pleasant side, but very often, the exterior of warm pleasantries simply cover up the Truth. Many cannot savour the Truth - the Existence of God, the Creator of all things - yet, they are prepared to accept falsities, which are presented to them.
These are just passing forms of titillation and are meaningless. They succeed in distracting you and give you a false sense of security. But they have no substance.
Remember, your time on earth is simply a form of exile, brought about by sin.

I came to salvage the human race from sin, when I came the first time. Sadly, I was not welcomed. I was murdered and died on the Cross before I could claim My Kingdom. Now I will come again, as foretold, to claim the Kingdom, promised to Me by My Beloved Father. This time, I will prepare all of you for this event, for I promise you now, the greatest gift of all.
You, are a child of God, whether or not you accept this fact. You are very much loved. I will enlighten you, if you come to Me and ask Me to help you. There is nothing to fear, because I am your beloved Jesus, and for you, I died a death of great suffering. Your own suffering, where you wander lost, in confusion, and where you find it impossible to find peace, is almost over.
Come, follow Me. I have great plans and My Divinity will be proven to all. Even those who continue to reject Me will be presented with the Truth, when My Glorious Second Coming is witnessed by over seven billion people.
No one will deny I Exist then. They will find it impossible, yet many will refuse to accept the New Kingdom, which I will unveil for all of God's children.
Do not turn away, for I wish to save you and take you, and the whole of humanity, into the inheritance for which you were all born. Your beloved Jesus

Virgin Mary: The times ahead will be challenging for all Christians
Friday, January 4th, 2013 @ 12:30

My dear children, you must pray that the Christian Churches wake up to the Truth of these Messages. It will be by the power of their numbers that they will continue to uphold the Teachings of my Son.
He, my precious Son, desires the loyalty of all of His followers. You must pray that those amongst His Churches, with responsibility for the daily proclamation of His Holy Word, remain loyal to Him at all times.
I must urge you not to listen to any new doctrine which will be presented in the Name of my Son, Jesus Christ, which does not come in His Holy Name.
The times ahead will be challenging for all Christians. You will need great perseverance if you wish to remain true to God.

When you are challenged, bullied and persecuted, by other Christians, to accept new laws, which you will know in your heart are not from God, then you must recite this Crusade Prayer to keep you true to your Faith.
Crusade Prayer (91) Keep me true to my Faith

O Blessed Mother of Salvation, protect me in my hour of need, when I am confronted with evil. Help me to defend the Word of God with strength and courage, without any fear in my soul.
Pray that I remain loyal to the Teachings of Christ and that I can fully surrender my fears, my worries and my sadness, completely.

Help me, so that I can walk fearlessly ahead on this lonely path, in order to proclaim the Truth of the Holy Word of God, even when the enemies of God make this task almost impossible.
O Blessed Mother, I ask that, through your intercession, the faith of all Christians remains strong, at all times, during the persecution. Amen.
Children, you must remember that when your faith is constantly being challenged, insulted and sneered at, that my Son suffers with you. This suffering and persecution is as it was during His cruel trial, during which He was accused of heresy for simply speaking the Truth.
The Truth, when spoken, attracts controversy, anger and, sometimes, violence. Know that my Son will give you the strength you will need, to endure this time of great difficulty.
Listen children to my call. I will intercede, on your behalf, to keep you strong, and my Son will shower you with special graces to enable you to avoid being bullied into accepting blasphemous laws, which will cause a great rift in the Christian Churches and, in particular, the Catholic Church.
I love you and offer you my prayers at every stage of your journey on the path of Truth. Your beloved Mother
Mother of Salvation

Please recite this Crusade Prayer (92) for the Grace of Perseverance
Sunday, January 6th, 2013 @ 17:50

My dearly beloved daughter, it is through the Holy Spirit that strangers, from all over the world, are now responding to this call from Heaven.
It can only be by the Power of the Holy Spirit that so many thousands of souls have come together with love in their hearts in order to follow My Crusade Prayer Groups.
You will know, immediately, when a Mission from God is authentic, by the numbers who are called and who unite as one in My Holy Name. No questions are raised. No monies sought. No arguments. All simply join together, out of their love for Me. Because of the response of so many souls to My Crusade Prayers, in so many nations, I now give them this Blessing.
My beloved disciples, you bring Me great joy and comfort. For the loyalty and the perseverance you have demonstrated, I bless you with the Gift of Holy Spirit. From this day, for every task you undertake, to help Me to save souls, before My Second Coming, I will give you a special grace, which you will recognise immediately. It is the Grace of Perseverance in the face of adversity.
Please recite this Crusade Prayer (92) for the Grace of Perseverance

O dear Jesus, I ask you for the Gift of Perseverance.

I beg You to bestow upon me the graces I need to uphold Your Most Holy Word. I ask You to rid me of any lingering doubts.
I ask You to flood my soul with kindness, patience and perseverance. Help me to remain dignified when I am insulted in Your Holy Name.
Make me strong and cover me with the grace to keep going, even when I am tired, lacking in strength and when faced with all the tribulations, which lie ahead, as I work tirelessly to help You save humanity. Amen.
Go, My precious followers, and know that My Heart bursts with love and joy as I witness your love when you respond to My Call. I love you. I cover you with My Precious Blood.
Your Jesus

Only by the Power of God, do you exist. Only by the Love of God will you live forever
Monday, January 7th, 2013 @ 22:15

My dearly beloved daughter, you may wonder why, when I communicate with you, that it seems like the most natural thing in the world.
Sometimes you ask why you do not feel overpowered by My Presence. I allow this, for you would find it impossible to stand before My Presence, as you would faint with the Power of My Light. Yet, I allow you to glimpse a little of this Divine Light, as a special Gift. It is because then you will grasp just how powerful My Light, My Love and My Spirit is.
If man were to glimpse, but just a fraction of My Divine Presence, he would be so overwhelmed that he could not stand the Light, as it would blind him.
This is the distance, which sin places between man and his Creator. When My Light is shown to souls, they can only be embraced by Me, in My Kingdom, when they have been purified. Only those of you who humble yourselves before Me can be enveloped within the Light of My Mercy. No matter how much you claim to love Me, you must redeem yourselves constantly before Me, if you are to be given this Gift of My Mercy.
To each sinner, I say this. Not an hour goes by, when, in your thoughts, through your lips and by your actions, do you not sin. But, when you quietly accept your weakness, and are full of love for Me, and I can see your sorrow, then I will forget your iniquities in an instant.
When I come to cover you with My Divine Mercy, before My Second Coming, it will be to offer you the purification needed, so that you can be embraced and taken into the security and safety of My Divine Light. My Light, on that day, will cover the earth.
Many, although blinded by the Light of My Great Mercy, will instantly accept My Hand of Salvation.

To be accepted into the Light of My Mercy, you must accept that the Power of God is eternal. Only by the Power of God do you exist. Only by the Love of God will you live forever. Those who reject the Light can only find darkness. Darkness can only mean one thing - that you accept the life of eternal suffering offered to you by the evil one.
Allow My Light to shine down upon you, but first, you must earn the right to share in this powerful Light, which offers you a place in My Kingdom, forever.
I bless you. I call you. Come to Me, without fear, for I wait patiently for you. If only you would come to Me, you would then understand the Truth of My Promise.
Your Jesus

Do not listen to exaggerated claims you may hear about the end times
Tuesday, January 8th, 2013 @ 21:00

My dearly beloved daughter, when I wish to prepare the world for My Second Coming, I must ask that all of My followers trust in Me, completely. I love you. I will always respond to your prayers, in order to mitigate the evil acts, which are being planned in the world by the enemies of God.
I protect you, My beloved followers. While I could never hide the Truth from you, I must warn you against the inaccurate prophecies, which are being delivered by false prophets in the world at this point in time, and which create terror in the hearts of souls.
The Hand of My Father, as I have told you before, will fall on those wicked people, when they try to take God's children from the earth before they are fit to enter My Kingdom.
You must never allow fear to destroy hope, or terror to destroy love. Love will destroy evil. Love will increase in the world and be spread because of the Grace of God, in response to the prayers of His children.
Do not listen to exaggerated claims you may hear about the end times. Do not allow such tales, many of which amount to fiction, to upset you or frighten you.
I, Jesus Christ, in My Mercy, will destroy evil, as I will never give up on souls. God is Love. God's Power is Almighty. God is Merciful. Never forget that.
Pray, pray, pray, for you must not allow your hearts to be troubled when prayer can mitigate much of the evil in the world. Surrender to Me in love, hope and joy and I will take away all your fears and unnecessary worries.
When you are preparing for a great celebration you will always be joyful and excited. And, although many disruptions and difficult setbacks may occur before the great day, all will be forgotten when the sun rises at dawn on the much anticipated day.
This is how you must look upon My Second Coming. While the evil you will witness in the lead up will frighten and disgust you, it will be short lived, for soon it will have all been forgotten.
Be at peace. Never lose hope in My Great Mercy. I will never forsake those who love Me. Your Jesus

When you take away the Truth, or tamper with it, it is no longer the Truth. All that is left is a shell
Wednesday, January 9th, 2013 @ 10:45

My dearly beloved daughter, how familiar I Am, through the tongues of man, every single day, and yet, I Am so far away from them.
Many, instinctively, call out My Name aloud, in moments of expression, without actually realising how they use My Name. Not only Am I not revered; no respect of any kind is shown to Me. My Name is used to curse others, at times of great friction. How this hurts and shocks Me; that I Am used in this way.
Many use My Name in daily conversation, but not in a way, which addresses My Role as the Saviour of the human race.

How I wish that I could call upon those atheists and agnostics, so that they could listen to how they use My Name, in their daily conversations. If it is a habit, then why don't you use another form of expression? Why do you include Me, if you do not accept Me? Why do you use Me as a form of blasphemy, when you do not believe I Exist?
So many people dismiss Me as not being important in their lives. I Am pushed to one side as if I Am of no consequence.

Many souls, who do believe in Me, do not practise their faith. As such, they fail to prepare their souls. So many do not know when they will be taken from this earth and into the next life and have made a terrible mistake. For, they are not fit to enter My Kingdom.
The day when souls find themselves divided into two groups, the Truth of the future will finally be revealed to them. Woe to the man who has not prepared for this great day and who wasted the time accorded to him on earth.
To the others who have refused to listen to the Truth and who publicly demeaned and rejected Me, their terror will be impossible to describe. There will be weeping, hysteria and shock witnessed on that day, as these souls see that the path they chose led them only into the fires of the abyss.
This is the time of spiritual renewal for souls who have been blessed with the Gift to see how the prophecies of old are now taking place in the world as foretold.
I look at the world and I see terrible confusion, as people are being sucked into lies about how the world was created - these lies, which are designed to turn people away from the Truth.
I see good people being told to reject their understanding of My Teachings and to throw them aside in favour of accepting Sin. Then they are encouraged to applaud sin until they convince themselves that I, Jesus Christ, will turn a blind eye.
The Truth of My Teachings lies at the very kernel of Christianity. When you take away the Truth, or tamper with it, it is no longer the Truth. All that is left is a shell.
It is time to discern whether or not you are prepared to allow yourselves to be deceived by modern new age spiritualism, or to stand firm and defend the Holy Word of God. It may not seem to matter to you now, but when the day comes, when I come to Judge, only the Truth will be acceptable in My Kingdom.
When you accept lies, you are not being honest. You are not being truthful. Therefore, you will not receive Graces. You will be like an empty vessel, which sails in the seas, boasting of a cargo, which exists only in your minds. It will be of no use to anyone, this false sense of security. It will not give you access to the keys of My New Paradise.
Pray every day, as if tomorrow is your last day, because you do not know the time of My Second Coming. It will happen unexpectedly. When that day dawns, there will be little time to turn back. You will either accept Me, and My Promise to bring you into My Kingdom, or you will be sent to the place from which there is no return.
Your Jesus

I now grant them the Grace of the Tears of Love and Conversion
Friday, January 11th, 2013 @ 11:25

My dearly beloved daughter, please hear Me and listen as I reveal My Pain. My Head, covered with thorns, is being crushed painfully, as I endure the pain of My Crucifixion, two thousand years after My Time on earth.
The Time for My Second Coming is very close. Let no man doubt My Promise to come again. Let no man doubt that it can be at any time. Prepare your souls, for the time is close. Far better, that you concentrate on the state of your souls, than on the state of your future prosperity.
The pain of thorns is now being felt by leaders in the Catholic and Christian Churches. They suffer, so, as they are being force-fed doctrines, dictated to them by political leaders, which pour forth from the mouth of the beast.
To all those who attack My Word, through these Messages, I must warn you that the battle between God and Satan, at the end time, is now. May My Father pardon you for your misdemeanours. May He pour down His Mercy on your misguided and wayward ways, all of which, condone sin.
The pain of the Crown of Thorns, which are being pressed down, in agony, upon My Christian Churches on earth, is being replicated, at this time, as foretold. The pain of rejection - the rejection of My Word, My Existence and My Teachings - is being felt, not only by Me, but by all of those poor souls who honour Me, who proclaim My Holy Word and who love Me.
My Heart is entwined with them in love and suffering. They will know this, immediately, for I now grant them the Grace of the Tears of Love and Conversion, when they recite this Crusade Prayer.
Crusade Prayer (93) For the Tears of Conversion

O My beloved Jesus, You are close to my heart. I am one with You.
I love You.

I cherish You.

Let me feel Your Love.

Let me feel Your Pain.

Let me feel Your Presence.

Grant me the Grace of humility so that I am made worthy of Your Kingdom on earth, as it is in Heaven.

Grant me the Tears of Conversion so that I can truly offer myself to You as a true disciple to help You in Your Mission to save every single soul on earth, before You come again to judge the living and the dead.
Amen.

Go My beloved followers. I promise that I will grant you the Grace of the Tears of Conversion so that you will truly become united within My Sacred Heart when you recite this prayer.
My Heart embraces you, My cherished and loyal disciples. I love you. I Am with you now, in a way, which you will find hard to deny.
Your beloved Jesus

The plan to destroy the Catholic Church, from within its own ranks, is already underway
Saturday, January 12th, 2013 @ 15:10

Saturday, January 12, 2013 15:10 hours

My dearly beloved daughter, this is the time for the next phase in My Plan to prepare the world for the New Era, the New Paradise, the Kingdom, promised by Me, the Son of Man.
My army must now gather and link as one in prayer, for the battle for souls has now intensified. The plans by the evil group, on a global scale, to legitimise wars, murder through euthanasia and abortion, is gathering momentum.
The plan to destroy the Catholic Church from within its own ranks is already underway. Those souls in positions of power, and especially those within Christian Churches, who condone sin and try to legislate for it, know this. You will suffer terribly. The Hand of My Father will intervene and destroy your plan.
For every man and woman who tries to bring in laws against the Will of God, they will face a terrible chastisement. Not only will they be struck down, their own nations will also be chastised.
Enough has been endured by My Father. He will no longer tolerate such interference in His Creation. The earth will be shaken and not one man will fail to notice.
What wickedness there is. And what cunning is in place, where terrible abominations are being introduced by humanity, which insult God. By these acts, man will have to face the Wrath of My Father. Prayer, and much of it, can halt this wickedness. And it is because of your prayers that the Divine Interventions, to punish mankind, have been delayed. Now those nations, whose rulers are driven by the spirit of evil, will be wiped out.
My beloved followers, you will suffer greatly as you witness the acts of disobedience against the Laws of God. You must keep praying in order to mitigate the punishments by My Father.
Now, you must set up as many prayer groups for My Crusade of Prayers as possible in every nation. By doing this you will allay the work of the evil group.
My patience is never ending, but man will be punished, before My Second Coming, for his wicked deeds. This punishment has been delayed for some time, but My Father will permit ecological upheavals, in order to purify souls.
Here is an important Litany to help mitigate the punishment by My Father.

Litany Prayer (4) to mitigate punishment by God the Father

O God the Most High.

We beg You for Mercy for the sins of Your children. We thank You for the Gift of the earth.
We thank You for the Gift of human life. We treasure the Gift of life.
We uphold the Gift of life.

We thank You for the Gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ. We thank You for the Gift of Redemption.
We praise Your Divinity.

We surrender, completely, before You, so that Your Holy Will can be completed, on earth, as it is in Heaven. We thank You for the Gift of the Illumination of Conscience.
We thank You for the promise of eternal life. We welcome the New Paradise.
We beg You to save all souls, including those who torment You and those who are lost to You. We thank You for the Love you show all Your children.

We thank You for the Gift of prophecy. We thank You for the Gift of prayer.
We ask You to grant us peace and salvation. Amen.

My daughter, this Mission will become even more difficult, as the hatred of man against man intensifies and divides.

God's loyal disciples will be tempted to give in to the sins, which will be disguised as the laws of tolerance. You must resist every attempt to turn your back on the Truth of My Teachings. When you leave all your trials in My Holy Hands, you will find this Mission to save souls, much easier.
Your Jesus

Ignore questions or demands made of you to change My Words
Sunday, January 13th, 2013 @ 12:10

My dearly beloved daughter, you must never forget Who your Master is. When you are being dragged in every direction, and when My disciples place enormous loads upon your shoulders, you must resist. Place yourself in My Holy Hands, remain alone and ask Me to handle everything.
You must only respond to My Voice. Any other voice, which commands you to do My Holy Work, according to their ways, their interpretations, must be ignored.
Many, who follow this Mission, must understand that My Holy Word may not be scrutinised, changed or adapted to suit others. My Word is Sacred. Accept what I say, in faith, and be content. Trying to find hidden meanings, sensation, or seek fortune-telling, is offensive to Me.
Learn to listen to My Voice. Let it touch your soul and be thankful that I give you this Gift of My intimate Teachings and desires. I do this out of compassion for you and because I love you. To question and demand that I give you the answers you want to hear is insulting to Me.
My daughter, please ignore questions or demands made of you to change My Words or the meaning of what I say to you. You do not, as I have told you before, have the authority to do so. Even when those devious souls plant difficult questions, to which you do not have the answer, remain silent.
To those of you who continue to try and trip Me up, by challenging and criticising My Holy Word, know that you are but a poor weak sinner. It is not that you ask questions for the good of your soul, which I find displeasing. It is your refusal to accept that I, Jesus Christ, could ever communicate to the world as I do now.
If you take My Word and twist it to suit your way it will become meaningless. If you then tear it apart, in order to defy this, My Holy Mission to save this last generation, then you will be thrown to one side.
My plan is powerful now as I lead humanity quickly onwards along the Path of Truth. Those who wander and stray will be left behind. There is only so much time left to save each of you. Why do you waste it? Every minute is precious.
Allow Me the chance to lead you, teach you and salvage you. Obedience to Me, your Jesus, is required if I Am to help you. You can only obey Me when you surrender your will to Me. When you do this, confusion will no longer be present in your soul.
Your Jesus

Despite My Divinity, I feel sickened by and disgusted with the sins of man
Monday, January 14th, 2013 @ 18:12

My dearly beloved daughter, the time for preparation for The Warning is short. This is a time when, no matter how painful the persecution is, you must ignore everything except My Holy Word.
As the preparations begin, let no one stop you, My beloved followers, as you prepare your souls and pray for those who will die in mortal sin during The Warning.
You, My followers and My sacred servants, will endure, now, the pain I feel, as I look down upon wretched sinners. Despite My Divinity, I feel sickened by, and disgusted with, the sins of man, as they are paraded before My Eyes.
Their arrogance, the insolence and the pride, demonstrated by these sinners, emulate, exactly, the traits of Satan and his demons. These same evil spirits have devoured the souls of God's children, so that they no longer seem like the children they once were, when they took their first breath.
So stuffed with pride, and convinced of their own invincibility, are they, that they are no longer capable of allowing the Spirit of God to touch their souls. This is why they need your prayers.
I bless you with the Grace to save these souls and you must, for My sake, help Me to help them.

Not content in satisfying his own lusts to feed his bodily desires, man then feels he must interfere with My Creation. He then takes steps where he tries, not only to emulate the Power of God, when it comes to the Creation of human life and the taking of human life, he thinks he has the power to replace the Existence of God. He believes now in his own divinity, which is nothing but a lie placed within his soul by Satan, to whom he has pledged his allegiance.
These steps, which man now takes, go beyond the boundaries permitted by God. Now that the Churches of God are to be besieged by the spirit of evil, from enemies and imposters, the punishment will finally descend upon the earth.
My Father's Power will be witnessed and His punishment will be severe. It will shock even the most arrogant sinner, who will be in no doubt whose Hand has fallen upon the earth. My Father will do this in order to rid the earth of wickedness, while enabling, at the same time, the growth of His army of loyal followers who will help in the salvation of souls.
Sin has damaged the earth you walk on and it can be seen in disease, pollution and the corruption among your governments. The stain of sin covers the world, so that it has become a disgusting and vile thing in the Eyes of My Father. He, who created the world as a place where He could nurture His family, is heartbroken.
My Father is also angry and the scales of justice have now tipped. His punishment cannot be stopped where it has become necessary.
Help your brothers and sisters, especially those who have created laws which interfere with those created by God, the Most High. You must do this through the Crusade Prayers. Be strong. Be brave. Be hopeful and fear nothing, if you love Me.
Your Jesus

Please take this new Gift of Healing I present to you now
Tuesday, January 15th, 2013 @ 22:50

My dearly beloved daughter, as this Mission continues to grow and expand around the world, it will come with new miracles, which, in My Love and Compassion, will be given to those who suffer terribly. When I came the first time, My Mercy was extended to those souls who needed My Help.
There will be those who will be infiltrated by a lack of faith and who will be afflicted by terrible physical suffering. Those who come to Me, I will ease their suffering. I will do this to ignite the faith of their souls, but it will be by the Power of the Holy Spirit, by which they can only be healed.
Bring Me your sufferings. Bring Me your worries. Bring Me your pain. Come to Me, through your prayers, and I will listen. I wish to take you all in My Sacred Arms and protect you.
Please take this new Gift of Healing I present to you now. It is in the form of a Crusade Prayer and will cure you in mind, body and soul.
By this prayer, I bequeath the precious Gift of Healing. By reciting it you will know that this request for help will bring down upon you, and those you include in this prayer, great gifts from Heaven. As such, it comes with a special protection for the renewal of those lost, who are unsure of their faith, and who feel a sense of weariness. They may be suffering from doubts. They may be suffering with physical diseases, which are destroying their ability to allow Me to bring them peace, love and comfort.
To receive this blessing for healing please recite this Crusade Prayer.

Crusade Prayer (94) To cure the mind, body and soul

O dear Jesus, I lay myself before You, weary, sick, in pain and with a longing to hear Your Voice.

Let me be touched by Your Divine Presence, so that I will be flooded by Your Divine Light through my mind, body and soul. I trust in Your Mercy.
I surrender my pain and suffering completely before You and I ask that You give me the grace to trust in You, so that You can cure me of this pain and darkness, so that I can become whole again and, so that I can follow the Path of Truth and allow You to lead me to life in the New Paradise.
Amen.

It is your faith that must concern you, first. Then, by the grace of My Mercy, will I respond to your request for healing, according to My Holy Will.
Your beloved Jesus

Everything will be done to cause disruption to your Prayer Groups
Thursday, January 17th, 2013 @ 23:17

My dearly beloved daughter, the Fire of the Holy Spirit has intensified amongst My Prayer Groups and they will now spread throughout the world, and multiply, one thousand-fold. The grace bestowed upon these Groups will enable them to set up quickly and grow just as I intended them to.
As the Fire of Truth engulfs the Earth, so also will the darkness descend, like a great thick fog. The evil one and his demons will torment as many as they can in order to take them away from Me. I cannot let him do this.
The pain of being separated from these poor souls, who give in willingly to the lies, fed to them by Satan, is very difficult for Me to bear. Nothing, however, can stop the Word of God, although it may not seem like this to many of you.
By My Power, I will spread love through those souls who respond to My call for Prayers. When they surrender their free will to Me, I can do what is necessary to draw them to the Love of God. This Love has been missing from their lives, for some time. They will then recognise the emptiness they had felt inside, before I bring them this comfort. The comfort they have been missing is the calmness of the soul, which can only come from Me.
Come to Me and I will help you to see all that matters. Listen to My Voice, now, as I gather all nations and bring My family together, so that I can prepare you for your new life where death will no longer exist. Neither death of the body or the soul can exist in My New Paradise. Death will be finished. My New Paradise is ready, but it must be filled with every single soul alive in the world today. This is My great desire.
To My followers, you must prepare now for the terrible trials, which you will have to face because of your response to My call. Everything will be done to cause disruption to your Prayer Groups. Many priests, for example, will try to stop them. You will be told not to attend them. You will be told that they are not permitted. You will be told My Prayers come from the spirit of evil. You will be given every kind of excuse - all of them simply meant to prevent My Work from being done.
I urge you to work together in peace and harmony. Do not allow differences of opinion to halt this Work. This is a time when Satan will try to drive a wedge between you all, so that the Crusade Prayers are not spread globally, as dictated by Me.
The Jesus to Mankind Prayer Groups must be set up everywhere. They will be an integral part of the formation and co- ordination of My Remnant Army on Earth. You must work closely, in love and harmony, and keep in touch with My daughter, Maria. I have instructed her to assist, where possible, in guiding you. I have sent her a group of people who will co-ordinate these groups in different regions in the world. You must each focus on your own region and link with each other. Maria will be instructed, by Me, as to how I need them to be managed and the format I desire.
I will bless each Prayer Group, when they agree to My Direction. I need members of the clergy involved and Prayer Books to be used. Maria will let you know what is expected soon.
Prepare for this global Mission, like no other. It is the Final Mission to save souls and every step of the way is dictated by Me, Jesus Christ. So, I ask that you place all your trust in Me. Rejoice, for you are blessed to be given this role in the most important time in the history of the world. For this, you will receive many Gifts from Me, as I need your help to save souls.
Allow Me to give you the Blessing of Protection for the Jesus to Mankind Crusade Prayer Groups in every single location, as they are being set up.
My Love, My Blessing, My beloved disciples. You bring Me peace, love and comfort at this time. Your beloved Jesus

The abolition of all signs of my Son will mean the beginning of the end
Friday, January 18th, 2013 @ 19:30

My children, the tide has turned, as sin continues to spread everywhere. As sin becomes acceptable in the hearts of man, the earth will groan in agony beneath the weight of darkness.
The World War is being staged and soon it will reveal the ugliness, which lies in the hearts of world leaders, who are united, as if by an umbilical cord.One feeds the other, but soon none will remain a leader in their own nations, because they will only answer to one master, the antichrist.
To many, the world may seem the same, but, it is not. It is because of the evil, brought about by the demons incarnate who wander the corridors of power, that the whole of humanity will suffer. The power, held by these slaves to evil leaders, will mean that civil rights will disappear. The signs can already be seen. Soon, they will all be abolished and you will have to trust in my Son, and surrender to Him, so that you can withstand the injustices, which you will have to bear witness to.
The abolition of all signs of my Son will mean the beginning of the end. Once this happens, you will know that the time for the Second Coming is close.
You must keep in prayer, children, and continue to recite the Crusade Prayers, for they are very powerful and will help to mitigate the suffering which is being planned by the evil group.
The earth will now shake where the seats of these demonically influenced leaders are located. The Hand of God, the Most High, will strike the earth, but many of those who lead sinful lives can be saved through your prayers.
The influence of the evil one is now being felt amongst the Churches and those who proclaim the Holy Word of
God. They are the primary targets of the evil one and the antichrist will not relent in his pursuit to destroy all Christian Churches.

Pray, pray, pray for the army of Christ to remain calm and at peace. It will be when you trust completely in my Son, through the surrender of your free will, that you will become strong. Then you will be able to withstand these trials.
Your beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

You devour, so easily, those false words presented to you by liars
Friday, January 18th, 2013 @ 20:15

My dearly beloved daughter, how easy it is for My Voice to be drowned out by the screeches of the false prophets who infiltrate the world at this time.
How foolish are those amongst you, including My faithful followers, who are so hungry for My Love, that you devour, so easily, those false words, presented to you by liars.
Don't you know that I only convey My Word to, but, just a few souls? Have I not told you that My Words, given to you, now, are the last of their kind?Why then do you eagerly seek out the words of newly declared prophets who claim to speak on My behalf? Their desire is to seek glory and attention. What they do is feed My flock with a weak alternative, full of words with no substance. For many of those poor souls, they mean no harm as many are being led by their devotion to Me, in order to impart the Love of God. Yet I do not instruct them to do so, for I do not reveal to them My Sacred Word, or details of My Sacred Plan.
Others, sadly, are being influenced by the spirit of evil in order to detract from My Holy Word.

While so many voices, from the mouths of false prophets, command the attention of many, My True Voice is cast to one side. To those of you who seek out My Voice, and who witnessed the words of many self-proclaimed prophets, you must listen to Me now.
There are chosen souls through whom I have communicated for decades. I still communicate with them. Since the start of this Mission, I have not given one more single soul permission to proclaim My Word in public at this time, with the exception of those beloved chosen souls who have worked for Me for years.
How do I raise My Voice, so that you can hear Me? What is it you seek? Is it the Truth? Is it sensation? Is it poetry - which reminds you of how My Word should appear on paper? Why then, of all the prophets who say they speak on My behalf, do you reject Me through these Messages?
Oh how you are being deceived. How you are being drawn away from My Loving Arms. How you are being seduced to listen to sweet sounds, which bear no similarity to My True Word.
The time will come when you will be ashamed of your cruelty, your bitter rejection of My Holy Word, your stubborn refusal, borne out of the sin of pride, to embrace My Sacred Word, at this time. For this is the time for the Truth to be revealed to humanity, for the sake of your souls and the souls of every man, woman and child.
I promised the world that the Truth would be revealed to them during this time, yet so many of you are blind and deaf to the Word of God. I ask that you reflect on your quest for My Mercy, My Word and My Promise. Then you must beg Me to guide you and give you the clarity of mind, so that you can see Me, hear Me, trust Me and, finally, surrender in full to My desire to save your soul. You must not waste time pondering, or being led astray, for I need you.
Your Jesus

Virgin Mary: You must fight every law and every argument which promotes abortion
