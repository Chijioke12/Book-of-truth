My teachings, which have never changed since My Holy Scriptures ended with the Book of Revelations, are now being challenged.
There have been a number of challenges, opinions and theological assessments of My Holy Word throughout the centuries. Many fine men questioned the instructions and the teachings which I imparted to mankind.
Some of My teachings were taken apart, analysed, new interpretations sought and then accepted.

Yet this has been unnecessary. For the truth was given to man by the prophets who came before Me and then by Me during My time on earth.
The truth has never changed. The truth is simple.

Other information, not contained in Holy Scripture was given as a gift to the world through chosen souls for one reason only. To help you contemplate on My sacrifice for mankind and to show and remind you of the love I hold in My heart for all of God's children.
Any divine revelations given to the world today are to help you prepare for Eternal Life.

My teachings, honoured by the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, are now being attacked in the first of many challenges which will result in the division of the Church.
New laws will be introduced to suit modern opinion and so that they sit comfortably with those who, with pride in their souls, feel a need to pacify mankind rather than show obedience to the teachings of the Church.
I am the Church. The Church was founded by Me and it can never die.

Many, including those from within, as well as from outside the Church, will attempt to break down its structure.

Pray that My Holy Vicar Pope Benedict XVI will remain strong amidst the opposition he now faces.

This is a deliberate attempt by those connected with the False Prophet to create a new church.

These cunning people will have you believe it will be the same Church but it cannot be.

How can My Church, with new laws, twisted versions of the truth I gave to the world, represent Me? It can't. This is why My Father will direct His Church, the true loyal believers, from the Heavens.
He will hold the keys until the Second Coming when the New Jerusalem will rise, the one true Catholic Church, out of the ashes to be reclaimed by all of God's children, all religions, all creeds as one.
This is the way it was meant to be in full and final union in the New Era of Peace on earth. Your beloved Jesus Christ

Heaven and earth will become one. One won't exist without the other.
