You, My children, who know Me, your beloved Father, must fight against the temptations placed before you every minute of the day.

You have been filled with the Holy Spirit through a special blessing given to the world by My Son on 10th May 2011. You must understand the responsibilities you now face.
Because you are joining as one army, which will form the beginning of My remnant army on earth, you will be attacked on all sides.
Your faith and allegiance to Me, your beloved Father and My precious Son Jesus Christ will be tested beyond your endurance.
You will, by following My Son, have to bear the weight of His cross and this won't be easy.

You will be filled with doubts, interior sufferings and trials and, at times, you will want to turn your back.

Many people in whom you trust may try to discourage you.

You will be told that you are imagining things, that you suffer from delusions and then you will be mocked, sneered at and rejected.
You may even find that you will succumb to lies and deceit which will be designed to persuade you to reject these messages.

It will require tremendous faith and courage to take up your cross and follow My Son to help prepare humanity for His Glorious Return to earth.
You will be tripped and traps will be set.

Never fall into the trap of being asked to judge people if they don't accept these messages. Never fight another when defending My Holy Will.
Love each other.

Show patience to those who not only sneer and find fault with these messages but who pour scorn on you as a person. Remain silent. Show patience. Show love to those who profess to speak in My name.
Never judge another in My name for you do not have the authority.

Never slander another in My name. When you do this you break My Commandments. Pray for those who hurt you, even when it is in My name.
Children I need you to unite as one. Throw all your differences aside.
The poor souls who need your attention are not those who are already converted but those who do not know Me at all.

Pray now for all of My children who know nothing about Me.

Pray, too, for those who do know about Me but who refuse to acknowledge Me, their Creator, their beloved Father who loves them tenderly.
I wish to unite all of My children.

I urge you to drop all your weapons of fear, anger and impatience and allow Me to take you on the journey to Paradise.

This journey will be torturous but the love and peace you will find at the end will be the balm you so desperately need to calm your souls.
Calmness children is important.

Patience is needed.

Love for one another, including those who hurt or offend you, is essential in order to enter the Reign of My Beloved Son in the New Heaven and Earth in the Paradise I promised you so long ago.
Your Beloved Father God the Most High

The world is about to undergo the next stage of cleansing.
