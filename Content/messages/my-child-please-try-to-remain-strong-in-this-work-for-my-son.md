It is important that all those who believe in the Truth of the Holy Word, being given to the world at this time, remain calm.

Your duty is to respond to my beloved Son's instructions. Prayer and trust in my Son will bring about your salvation.

The gift of the Seal of the Living God will be your biggest protection at a time of war or strife.

By pledging allegiance to God the Father, through the acceptance of this free gift,  you will remain free.

Never forget the power of prayer and how it can dilute the impact of such events.

Sadly, many of these events must come to pass for they have been prophecised.

Children, I call on all those who revere me, your Blessed Mother, to understand that this is calling from Heaven.

All my visionaries in the world will be instructed to pray in order to avert the dangers associated with a world war.

You must persevere in your suffering and offer it as a gift to God the Father.

My daily Rosary is important at this time no matter what Christian Church you belong to.

You must recite it because it offers protection to those nations who say it daily and in great numbers.

Pray, pray, pray for Europe at this time and turn to my Son and ask Him for the strength, courage and perseverance required to retain your trust in God.
Your beloved Mother Queen of Heaven and Earth Mother of Salvation

Set up prayer groups devoted to Jesus to Mankind
Wednesday, May 16th, 2012 @ 17:38

My dearly beloved daughter I must emphasise, to all those who believe in Me, that is important to pray for each of your nations. To do this effectively you must set up prayer groups, devoted to "Jesus to Mankind".
Use this Group to recite all the Crusade Prayers given to you.

My daughter, Maria, will arrange to have those put up in a way which will allow you to print them off anywhere you are in the world.
Please spread My Holy Word to all members of the clergy. Some will reject My messages.
Others will embrace them with love in their hearts.

However, for the most part, you will be ridiculed and rejected in My Holy Name.

You will suffer as My apostles suffered and will be made a laughing stock in some quarters of My Church on earth.

These verbal and abusive insults will be intense and you will be hurt. But I say this.

Remember the hatred shown to you will prove that it is, indeed I, Your Jesus, speaking to you from Heaven.

For this suffering I will make you rise again and again every time you are kicked to the ground.

I will raise you up and make you stronger than before.

Why do I do this? I do it so that you will become fit and stronger to spread My Holy Word.

For only then will you receive greater Gifts which I will provide you with through My Holy Spirit.

So rise and move to prepare your nation so that they it will receive the armour it needs to avoid the Mark of the Beast. Never forget the importance the Seal of the Living God.
It will offer you and your family protection, not just in spirit but a physical protection also.

You are blessed to receive the Seal and it is your duty to ensure that as many of God's children everywhere receive it.

Remember I stand by all of My Followers every minute and when they carry out My work they will receive special Graces to make them brave, strong and determined to save the souls of every man, woman and child in the world.
Your Beloved Saviour

Virgin Mary: This Seal was foretold in the Book of John

My child, God's children will be able to protect their faith, their courage and their safety during any war if they continue to pray the Seal of the Living God Crusade Prayer.
This is one of the last, and the greatest Seal of Protection, sent from the Heavens of all prayers given to humanity. It is to help sustain all during any future persecution, especially at times of domination and war.
This Seal was foretold in the Book of John and has many divine powers associated with it.

Cherish it and use it to protect, not only yourselves, but your families. This reminder is needed at this time.
Go in peace.

Your Beloved Mother Mother of Salvation

The One Remnant Church which will stand, undefeated, until the rise of the New Jerusalem.
