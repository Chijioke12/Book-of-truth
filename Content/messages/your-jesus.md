Guidelines for Crusade of Prayer Groups
You can also download these guidelines in pdf format.

My dearly beloved daughter it must be known that I wish to form an army of prayer groups around the
world. I will provide you, My army, with prayers that will need to be recited to save souls. These prayer groups will expand and within its ranks will rise a veritable army of devoted followers to bring forth the Truth of My Divine Promise of Salvation for all.
These groups will form the army as dictated by My beloved Father, which will tackle the darkness of evil caused by Satan and his believers and followers.
These prayers were written in Heaven and promise extraordinary Graces.

They have one purpose only and that is to save the souls of everyone; every child; every creed; each sex; every religious denomination and atheists. This is My greatest desire.
You, My disciples, are under My direction. The Graces I pour over you are already bearing fruit. Soon the powers I will give, through the Graces of the Crusade Prayers, will draw thousands of new souls.
How, you may think, can a small prayer group achieve such conversions? The answer is simple. It is because you are protected by My Father, and guided by Me directly, that you will succeed. You cannot fail.
August 10, 2011 message

Patience, silent prayer daily, the formation of prayer groups, daily recital of the Divine Mercy Chaplet, fasting and the Holy Rosary to My Beloved Mother combined, act as the perfect formula for saving souls.
At least two people must gather. In time hopefully many will join in this Mission to save all souls. This can be done in homes or public places where you are permitted to gather. If possible this gathering should be in houses of worship. People are to meet as often as possible. Even if you must start with one or two days a week and have different people coming each day if you are able to meet daily which is the goal, this will at least get you started. If your group is large enough you can have a leader and organizer volunteer or several people can share that responsibility or just rotate and share this responsibility. Perhaps you can move from house to house.
It is recommended that you begin with prayer.

At least one Mystery of Our Lady's Most Holy Rosary prayed slowly and from your hearts paying attention to what you are saying and knowing what you are saying and to whom you are speaking is recommended both in the Rosary and in the Crusade Prayers and the Chaplet of Divine Mercy. In addition all Litany Prayers and Crusade Prayers 1, 30, 33 and 102 should be prayed daily.
Remember that Our Lady has promised to place a circle of protection around those who pray three Mysteries of her Most Holy Rosary daily. Our Lady has asked people of all faiths to pray her Rosary.
How to pray the Rosary will be listed below.

Recent Messages, which have been given since the last meeting, should be read slowly and respectfully. No one is to interpret the Messages because Jesus has already said that even Maria Divine Mercy is not qualified to interpret them. An incorrect interpretation could turn souls away and the goal of this Mission is to reach out all souls of all faiths or no faith. No one is excluded. It would be helpful if copies of the Messages you read can be handed out for those who do not have a computer.
It is recommended that all of the Crusade Prayers and Litanies be prayed giving adequate time when it is requested for people to add their own intentions. It is best for people to pray their intentions silently. Perhaps people can bow their heads and then raise them when they are finished so that you can proceed without cutting anyone off. Remember some people have large families and many intentions and it is important that these all be included. In the Second Litany it is recommended that souls in complete darkness and those who will die this day be included with your other intentions.
If the group gets large enough perhaps a leader can stand at the front of the group so that they will know when people have completed their intentions and the prayers can contine.
Then the recital of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy from your hearts followed by the special prayer given by Our Lord which will be listed below. The Chaplet may also be sung. The remaining Mysteries of the Rosary should also be prayed if time allows the group to do this together. If not all can remain for the final Mysteries it is recommended that those who are able remain to pray them. Remember that there is great power in your praying together as a Crusade Prayer Group.
Discussions of the Messages should be limited to direct and exact quotes from the original messages. It is highly recommended that all pray for discernment regarding the Messages because of the great danger in misinterpreting the Messages. It is recommended that if you have difficulty in understanding a particular Message that you pray about it.

If the group gets large enough you can rotate the recitation of the Rosary from one side of the church to the other.

It is very important not to rush. These Prayer Groups will do great work as they are part of God's army in this battle for souls. Prayer is the weapon. Please try to keep in mind that the finer the prayer the finer the weapon.
While Our Lord has requested that we pray the Chaplet of Divine Mercy at 3:00 PM, He has also requested that we pray it many times a day.
The Chaplet of Divine Mercy

In 1933, God gave Sister Faustina a striking vision of His Mercy. Sister tells us:
"I saw a great Light, with God the Father in the midst of it.	Between this Light and the earth I saw Jesus nailed to the Cross	and in such a way that God, wanting to look upon the earth, had to	look through Our Lord's Wounds and I understood that God blessed	the earth for the sake of Jesus."
Of another vision on Sept. 13, 1935, she writes:

"I saw an Angel, the executor of God's wrath... about to strike	the earth...I began to beg God earnestly for the world with words which I heard interiorly. As I prayed in this way, I saw the	Angel's helplessness, and he could not carry out the just punishment...."
The following day an inner voice taught her to say this prayer on	ordinary rosary beads:

Start by making the Sign of the Cross:  In the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

"First say one 'Our Father', 'Hail Mary', and 'I believe in God'. Then on	the large beads say the following words:
'Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity	of Your dearly beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, in atonement	for our sins and those of the whole world.'
On the smaller beads you are to say the following words:

'For the sake of His sorrowful Passion have mercy on us and on the	whole world.'

(Repeat these two prayers for all five decades).

In conclusion you are to say these words three times:

'Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us	and on the whole world'.

Conclude with the Sign of the Cross.

In the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Then say:
Fill me now O Lord with the Gift of the Holy Spirit to carry Your Most Holy Word to sinners who I must help save in Your Name. Help me to cover them, through my prayers with Your Precious Blood so that they can be drawn to Your Sacred Heart. Give me the Gift of the Holy Spirit so that these poor souls can revel in Your New Paradise.
Jesus gave us the following request through Maria Divine Mercy:

Say this prayer every day after you recite My Divine Mercy and you, through your allegiance to Me, will help save My children. Jesus said later to Sister Faustina:
"Say unceasingly this Chaplet that I have taught you. Anyone who			says it will receive great Mercy at the hour of death. Priests will recommend it to sinners as the last hope. Even the most	hardened sinner, if he recites this Chaplet even once, will receive grace from My Infinite Mercy. I want the whole world to	know My Infinite Mercy. I want to give unimaginable graces to those who trust in My Mercy."
"When they say this Chaplet in the presence of the dying, I	will stand between My Father and the dying person not as the just judge but as the Merciful Savior".

How to Pray the Most Holy Rosary Mysteries of the Rosary
The Church has used three sets of mysteries for many centuries. In 2002 Pope John Paul II proposed a fourth set of mysteries- the Mysteries of Light, or Luminous Mysteries. According to his suggestion, if you can only pray one mystery a day, the four sets of mysteries might be prayed on the following days: the Joyful Mysteries on Monday and Saturday, the Sorrowful Mysteries on Tuesday and Friday, the Glorious Mysteries on Wednesday and Sunday, and the Luminous Mysteries on Thursday.
The Joyful Mysteries

1. The Annunciation  Mary learns that she has been chosen to be the Mother of Jesus.
2. The Visitation  Mary visits Elizabeth, who tells her that she will always be remembered.
3. The Nativity  Jesus is born in a stable in Bethlehem.
4. The Presentation  Mary and Joseph take the infant Jesus to the Temple to present Him to God.
5. The Finding of Jesus in the Temple  Jesus is found in the Temple discussing his faith with the teachers.
