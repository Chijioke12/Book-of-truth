---

My dearly beloved daughter I love all God's children but, at this time, the level of darkness which sweeps the world means that I weep with worry because of the state of their souls.
If they could only see it, touch it, savour it and witness the love and peace which lies ahead they would pray to Me every second of the day begging Me for the right to enter this New World, the New Era, the New Beginning.
It is the perfect state of unity for their families and all their brothers and sisters. It is not an empty promise. It is the Paradise created for all God's children.
The fallen angels, which sweep the world are seeking out souls everywhere in order to seduce them. They use violence, hatred and other temptations to encourage the widespread sin so evident everywhere. Pornography is now being spread in the most subtle ways to seduce and encourage sin.
Laws are being passed to ensure that sin is accepted everywhere. Even My Church is endorsing laws, which offend God.
It will continue like this until mankind will behave like animals with no sense of godliness.

Paganism is rampant and a fascination with the occult is being encouraged so that through the world of entertainment it will appeal to young souls.
Wake up now before it is too late to save your souls.

Parents must rise in unison in accordance with My Heart's desire to protect the young whose souls are the number one target of the evil one.
He knows how precious young souls are to Me and he will relentlessly seek them out.

I ask you to say this Crusade Prayer (73) for Young souls, Young Children.

O Jesus help me to save the souls of young people all over the world. By Your grace help them to see the Truth of Your existence.
Bring them to Your Sacred heart and open their eyes to Your Love and Mercy.

Save them from the fires of Hell and through my prayers have Mercy on their souls. Amen.

Your Jesus

This time is likened to the calm before the storm. Use it to prepare as many people as possible.

My dearly beloved daughter when you suffer because of Me, and when you feel isolated and beyond Me, know that this is when you are closest to My Sacred Heart.
Although this, My Book of Truth, is a Gift to the world from Me and is protected from Heaven, it does not mean that this journey will not be painful for you.
You will experience a criticism and a new kind of attack now that My Holy Word is printed for the world to share.

You must never respond to those who demand that you explain why this book was necessary. Remain silent and continue with My Work.
Do not let any one stop or delay the spread of My Book for every day counts as there is limited time for souls to be granted the time to redeem themselves in My Eyes.
Let me assure you, My daughter, and all of My followers, that you are now setting out on a journey, a pilgrimage, like no other. This time is likened to the calm before the storm.
Use it to prepare as many people as possible. Spread My messages, My Crusade Prayers, and pray for your brothers and sisters so that after The Warning they will accept My Mercy.
Gather My Church together and pray for strength for the False Prophet is preparing and is already present in the Vatican. But he hides his true façade very carefully. My beloved Vicar is being isolated and time is short.
I want all of you to begin a new Litany of Prayers for protection against the False Prophet and recite them once a day from now on.
The Crusade Prayers may be selected in different lots and recited as you can.

Here is the first Jesus to Mankind Litany Prayer (1) Protection against the False Prophet

Dearest Jesus save us from the deceit of the False Prophet. Jesus have Mercy on us.
Jesus save us from the persecution. Jesus preserve us from the antichrist. Lord have Mercy.
Christ have Mercy.

Dearest Jesus, cover us with Your Precious Blood.

Dearest Jesus, open our eyes to the lies of the False Prophet. Dearest Jesus unite Your Church.
Jesus protect our Sacraments.

Jesus don't let the False Prophet divide Your Church.

Dearest Jesus help us to reject lies presented to us as the truth. Jesus give us strength.
Jesus give us hope.

Jesus flood our souls with the Holy Spirit. Jesus protect us from the Beast.
Jesus give us the gift of discernment so we can follow

the path of Your True Church at all times forever and ever. Amen.

My daughter, please do not feel overwhelmed with this Mission for I will send you help soon. You must accept all that I ask of you and remain strong in the confidence that all is well.
The conversion is already obtained through these messages and amounts to hundreds of thousands of souls already. So do not feel helpless or worried. I am pleased with the loyalty and dedication of those who love Me without condition.
I am sending you those of Mine with pure hearts to offer you protection.

They will lift you and help you to lead My followers on the entire journey to the Gates of the New Paradise.

I love you My beloved followers. Persevere with Me on this thorny path. Accept the ridicule you will have to face as you continue to spread My Holy Word.
Know that I am always with each one of you. I know My own and they know Me. Nothing can separate us. Your Jesus

I am like a storm which is brewing. My Voice is like thunder in the distance
